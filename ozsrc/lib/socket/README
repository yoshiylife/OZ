				Socket library

o What is the socket library?

To provide socket communication facility.

Socket is the root abstract class.  UnixDomainDatagramSocket and
UnixDomainStreamSocket are subclasses of UnixDomainUnconnectedSocket.  Firstly,
you should open and listen to one of them (according to the type of
communication).  After accepting unconnected stream socket, you can get
ConnectedStreamSocket.

o Contents

    socket.oz      -- abstract class Socket
    uus.oz         -- abstract class UnixDomainUnconnectedSocket
    uds.oz         -- class UnixDomainDatagramSocket
    uss.oz         -- class UnixDomainStreamSocket
    css.oz         -- class ConnectedStreamSocket

    sockaddr.oz    -- class SocketAddress

    sock-exc.oz    -- shared SocketExceptions


o How to compile:

    1. Open appropriate school in your workbench.
    2. Select all *.oz files in this directory in your compiler front end.
    3. Give New public version IDs to all classes by selecting "Compile",
       "All", "New", then "from public" from the menu of compiler front end in
       order.
    4. Compile "Public & Protected" of "All" classes.
    5. Compile "Implementation" of "All" classes, and confirm to configure.
       That's all.
