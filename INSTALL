* To start:
 - Set search paths so that non-standard commands such as gcc, perl, 
   X Window (e.g. imake) can be executed.

 - Make a symbolic link of "Makefile" to "Makefile.ini".

 - Set the variables CONFIG and PROJECT of Makefile.ini in the following 
   way (if the setups of CONFIG and PROJECT are changed, repeat these 
   instructions):

    CONFIG:    the path to the configuration directory of X Window
        e.g.  CONFIG=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config
    PROJECT:   the path to the directory expanded by an archive
               (If NFS is used, this directory must be accessible through 
               NFS)
        e.g.  CONFIG=/usr/local/src/OZ++--RXXX

* To compile source files:
 - Execute "make World."
        e.g.  make World >& World.log &
              tail -f World.log

* To install the OZ++ system:
 - Become a super user.

 - Set the environment variable OZROOT to the directory where the OZ++ 
   system is installed. (If NFS is used, this directory must be accessible 
   through NFS.)
        e.g.  setenv OZROOT /usr/local/oz++

 - Execute "make install."
        e.g.  make install >& install.log & tail -f install.log

 - Refer to doc/README.nucleus to set necessary variables.
   (These setups can be made very simply by executing "make setup.")

 - Refer to the files in doc/  to activate the OZ++ system.

* To make an archive (e.g. OZ++-RX.tar.gz):
 - If you are a super user, exit from your super user's account.

 - Execute "make tar".

* To make an experimental OZ++ system using an already installed OZ++ system:
 - Edit the files .cshrc .login .profile to set the environment variable 
   OZROOT to the directory where the OZ++ system is used.

 - Change the current directory to one where the OZ++ system has already 
   been installed.  (This directory must be different from the one where 
   the archive is installed.)

 - Execute "make link".

 - If necessary, replace the symbolic links to the directory containing the 
   experimental files.

** Caution:
 - The directory in which the archive is expanded must not be the same as 
   the directory where the OZ++ system is installed.

 - Do not execute "xmkmf -a".

 - When the command "make" is executed, the last step "boot-class" takes 
   quite  a long time to process.

 - Refer to src/boot-class/README, if you wish to make changes in 
   src/boot-class.
   About 60 Mbytes of disk space are required to either compile or install 
   the OZ++ system.

 - Compiling the OZ++ system in an SS10 Sun workstation takes about one hour.

 - Installing the system in an SS10 Sun workstation takes about half an hour.
