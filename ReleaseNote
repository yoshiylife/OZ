		       OZ++ System, Version 1, Release 5

				 Release Notes

      Tsukuba Research Laboratory Of Open Fundamental Software Technology


   This document  describes  the  objectives  and  the  configuration  of  this
software  and  the features of this release.

1. What is OZ++ ?

In the software industry, people throughout the  world  have  been  continually
developing  software  with  very  similar  features;  and thus "reinventing the
wheel" as it were.  Such  redundancy  has  been  impeding  the  improvement  of
software  productivity and reliability. Therefore, the sharing and distribution
of not only information but also of software is needed over the  network  (i.e.
Internet).  However,  this  cannot  be  achieved  merely by opening the network
infrastructure and making software publicly available.
   The OZ++ system has therefore  been  developed  to  solve  this  problem  of
software transfer.  Based on the concept of object-orientation, the OZ++ system
provides distribution, upgrading, and authorization function of  software  over
the network. The high modularity of object-oriented systems and the conformance
checking  of  interface  between  objects  promotes  the  re-using  of software
components.  The infrastructure is now being put into place so that  components
of different software products can be combined in much the same way as hardware
products.  Because the OZ++ systems enables the distribution of software  (i.e.
program),  software  can  be  brought  from all over the world; furthermore, it
allows such software to  run  without  complicated  installation.  Because  the
versions  of  software  are automatically recognized by the system, old and new
versions are available at the same time and the newer version is  automatically
distributed.  In  addition,  validation functions have been included to confirm
the source of the software so that everyone can use it without  worrying  about
viruses.  Because  of these functions, OZ++ system users are always able to use
the newest and most appropriate types of software available.

2. The configurations of the OZ++ system

In OZ++, the computation is done by communicating  distributed  objects  placed
over  the  network.  Objects  are  run  on  processes  called  `executors'.  An
executor can run an arbitrary number of  objects  and  is  managed  by  process
called `nucleus'.  Each  station  is  always managed by a nucleus and a nucleus
can manage an arbitrary number of executors.
   See INSTALL for how to install the OZ++ system.

3. About this release

   This release contains the following:

    o Executor and Nucleus (execution mechanisms)
    o Workbench (a platform of programming tools: e.g. compiler)
    o Launcher (a tool to launch applications)
    o Debugger
    o Class libraries

Explanations of these contents can be found  in  a  group  of  documents  in  a
directory `doc'.
