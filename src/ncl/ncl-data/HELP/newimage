NAME
     "newimage" - This command gives an optional Executor-ID and start
                  command newimage up.

SYNOPSIS
     newimage [newimage options]

DESCRIPTION
     This command gets an optional Executor-ID from the nucleus and
     allocates it as an argument of the command "newimage," then start up.
     When newimage finishes normally, this command registers an Executor-ID
     acquired as the maintenance information of itself.

newimage OPTIONS
     `Newimage' recognizes the following options:

     -n This option puts a matched name to the obtained Executor-ID.
        You can nominate it by using an argument for the built-in command
        "cex" when you start to run an Executor.
     -c This option puts a remark to the obtained Executor.
     -g Set the kind of class to `without monitor'.
     -d domain-name
        Set the name of the domain to which this executor belongs to
        `domain-name'.
     -u user-name
        Set the name of the owner of this executor.
     -k configuration-name
        Use one of the standard configurations.  `Configuration-name' is
        one of the following:

            site-master, or 1
            station-master, or 2
            slave-with-class, or 3
            slave-without-class, or 4

     -o image-directory-path
        Target directory of executor image.
