NAME
     ncl - nucleus

SYNOPSIS
     ncl

DESCRIPTION
     Nucleus carries out the management (activation, generation) 
     of executor in general.  It has the following functions:

       * Provides information for the solution of network address
         Finds a solution for the network address of another unknown 
         executor when a demand arrives from the executor.
       * Carries out management of executor inside station
         Grasps the executor state when the executor is activated.
       * Broadcasts
         Nucleus enables broadcasts inside the site.
         There are two types of broadcasts performed by the nucleus:
           - solution for network address
           - search for class, name

     The shell variable OZROOT is root directory of OZ.

FILES
     * $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table
       When activated, nucleus obtains its nucleus table from a 
       file.
       At present, it is used by the half router nuclei to enable 
       them to recognize each other.
       Nucleus acts as the physical transceiver of broadcasts with
       other nuclei.
       If the nucleus can not transceive broadcasts because other 
       nuclei are beyond the range of physical transcription, the 
       half rooter inside the site acts as the 'middle-man' of 
       transcriptions.
     * $OZROOT/etc/site-id
       Nucleus obtains its site-id from a file.
     * $OZROOT/bin/executor
       The command path of executor.
     * $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/ExID_manage.log
       This is the Log information of allocations for the Executor-ID
       which only the Executor-ID Management Nucleus can update.
     * $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/log/<Hostname>
       Log file of Nucleus

SHARED MEMORY
     Nucleus, when activated, allocates shared memory with keys
     1 and 2 to the entities of executor table and Hash table 
     respectively.
     This is used to manage the network addresses of executors 
     that are either activated by the nucleus, or whose search 
     for the network address solution is successful.
