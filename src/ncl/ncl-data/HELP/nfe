NFE(1)              Nucleus Front-End Built-In-Command               NFE(1)

NAME
     nfe - Nucleus Front-End

SYNOPSIS
     nfe [Hostname]

DESCRIPTION
     nfe is a tool which connects itself to a nucleus and manages
     its generation state.
     If a hostname is specified to ncl as an arguments, it connects
     itself to the nucleus with that hostname, and exchanges
     information with it by means of built-in commands.  If no
     arguments are specified, nfe connects itself to its own host
     nucleus.

FILES
     * $HOME/.nclrc
       When nfe is activated, it executes the nfe command script
       $HOME/.nclrc.  The built-in commands of nfe can be written 
       in this script.

         Example:
           % cat $HOME/.nclrc
           alias c cex
           alias h help

EXAMPLE
     % nfe host1
