NFE(1)              Nucleus Front-End Built-In-Command               NFE(1)

NAME
     nclshutdown - shuts down (terminates) the nucleus at the
                   specified time

SYNOPSIS
     nclshutdown time

DESCRIPTION
     nclshutdown tells the nfe the time the nucleus should be 
     automatically shut down.
     The shutdown time is specified as the argument time. If
     "now" is specified, the nucleus is shutdown immediately. 
     Otherwise, the shutdown time is specified in the form of
     a +number which indicates the time in minutes.

     As the time to shutdown of the nucleus approaches, warning
     messages are displayed periodically in the nfe.

     If CONTROL-D is pressed within the time period specified
     by the +number, shutdown is aborted, and the nfe is terminated.

     If the nucleus is shut down, the nfe is terminated
      automatically.

EXAMPLE
     nfe> nclshutdown now
