This users manual explains how to use the environment of OZ++.
It comprises the following sections:
<P>
<OL><LI> Environment for running OZ++ programs:<BR> 
OZ++ can run on an existing OS.  It provides a distributed execution 
environment.  This section explains this environment.
<P>
<LI> Environment for developing OZ++ programs:<BR> 
OZ++ provides an environment for developing programs that are object 
oriented and have a distributed mechanism.  This section describes 
the operations of each tool for the program development environment.
<P>
<LI> Environment for instance-based OZ++ programming:<BR> 
Distributed programs can be easily denoted using OZ++.  However, its 
functions are too complicated for an average end-user to understand.
Thus, we have prepared a tool that makes the OZ++ environment easy 
to use for a user who may not have detailed knowledge about OZ++ 
programs.  This tool uses a combination of instances of OZ++ 
classes and a graphical environment.
<P>
<LI> Additional Information:<BR> 
The language specification of OZ++ is included here.
</OL>
<P>
The followings is a summary of topics in this manual.
<P>
<DL ><DT>2.1 Structure of OZ++ distributed objects: 
<DD>
This section explains the site setups for running OZ++.
<P>
<DT>2.2 How to make images: 
<DD>
This section describes a tutorial type user manual for newimage, 
which is a tool for appropriately configuring objects of OZ++ 
distributed object management system.
<P>
<DT>2.3 Launcher: 
<DD>
This is a tool for running OZ++ applications.  This section 
provides a user manual for this launcher, which vividly describes 
how to make and run OZ++ applications.  A tutorial is also included.
<P>
<DT>2.4 Nucleus: 
<DD>
This section explains the reference manual (in a manual page form) 
for the nucleus and its front end (nfe).  The synthesis, activation, 
and the deletion of the executor are explained.
<P>
<DT>2.5 Executor: 
<DD>
This section provides a list of options which can be specified 
when an executor is activated.
<P>
<DT>2.6 Application gateway: 
<DD>
This section provides a users' manual for the OZ application 
gateway.  The OZ application gateway is a proxy for safely 
broadcasting method activation and class transfer of OZ++ through 
a firewall.
<P>
<DT>3.1 OZ++ program style: 
<DD>
This section describes programming in OZ++ and a tutorial that 
shows the actual program execution steps.  It also provides simple 
explanations for each item in the menu.  Beginners of OZ++ must read 
this section.
<P>
<DT>3.2 Workbench operations: 
<DD>
This section describes the workbench for the OZ++ program 
development environment.  It also provides a user manual for 
programming tools of the browsers which can be activated from the 
workbench, and simple explanations for each item in the menu.
<P>
<DT>3.3 Operations of compiler front end: 
<DD>
This section provides a user manual for the compiler front end 
(CFE), and provides simple explanations of each item in the menu.
<P>
<DT>3.4 Inspector operations: 
<DD>
This section explains the operations of the tool which inspects 
the execution of OZ++ programs.
<P>
<DT>3.5 Debugger operations: 
<DD>
This section explains the debugger operations.
<P>
<DT>OZ++/Frame operations: 
<DD>
This section explains the operations of the tool OZ++/Frame where 
the OZ++ environment can be used without writing any programs.
<P>
<DT>4.2 Chess operations: 
<DD>
Chess is an application which runs on the OZ++/Frame, and provides 
object-oriented spread sheet functions.  This section explains the 
chess operations.
