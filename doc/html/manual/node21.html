OZ++ is an object-oriented environment based on exchanging and sharing
objects, and the language used for programming in this environment is
called OZ++ language.  OZ++ language is a distributed object-oriented
programming language which enables location transparent programming
with objects distributed on the network.  It has following features:
<P>
<UL><LI> Strong type system
<P>
<LI> Class name space
<P>
<LI> Multi-thread programming
</UL>
<P>
OZ++ language is based on C language.  That is, the following items of
C can also be used in OZ++:
<P>
<UL><LI> Almost all expressions used in C syntax
	(i.e. the operators of C can also be used as in OZ++)
<LI> All control structures
<LI> All fundamental types and their conversions  
</UL>
<P>
However, the some feature of C language described below cannot be
used.  This is because if invalid pointers are used, the resulting
damage to the Executor might prevent users from accessing shared
objects.  These restrictions are necessarily to maintain the
object-oriented characteristic of OZ++ language and the stability of
the entire system.
<P>
<UL><LI> Some parts of the type system
 (i.e. structures, unions, pointer types, enumerated types,
 type definitions, etc)
<P>
<LI> Type definitions
<P>
<LI> User-defined functions
</UL>
<P>
For low level programming and use of C language library resources, an
external language interface is available.  With this feature,
statements in C language can be written under some constraints.
<P>
In addition, to make OZ++ a distributed object-oriented programming
language, we include the following elements (which are not available
in C language):
<P>
<UL><LI> Three user-defined types (class, static class, record)
<LI> Message expressions
<LI> Concurrent programming
<LI> Exception handling
</UL>
<P>
Using these user-defined types(classes and static classes), and
message expressions, users can write program with object-oriented
features.  Multiple inheritance is possible in classes.  Methods are
dynamically bound.  In contrast, static classes doesn't have
the feature of inheritance and the dynamic binding of methods.
<P>
Also in OZ++, we provide objects in the form of global objects and
local objects:
<P>
<UL><LI> Global objects <BR> 
objects that can be accessed in distributed environments
<P>
<LI> Local objects<BR> 
objects that are the parts of global objects
</UL>
<P>
In OZ++, by using message expressions among global objects in
different computers, distributed programming is possible through the
network.
