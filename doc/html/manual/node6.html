<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00032100000000000000>2.2.1 Summary</A></H3>
<P>
This document describes how to use the tool `newimage' which prepares
object images of the OZ++ distributed object management system.
<P>
In OZ++, the computation is executed by communicating distributed
objects placed on distributed executors.  To execute user objects, 
objects of the OZ++ distributed object management system (hereafter 
called management objects) are required.  These objects should be 
created when the executors are created, and `newimage' is a tool 
to do that.
<P>
The usage of the `newimage' is described in following.  Please see
Configuration of OZ++ dispersion objects about which kind of objects 
should be placed where in your site.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00032200000000000000>2.2.2 Explanation of function</A></H3>
<P>
Object Image Files <BR>
<P>
In OZ++, 2 kind of objects exist.  One is `global object' which has 
an object ID valid in global and can be invoked even from other 
executors.  The other is `local object' which belongs to a global 
object.  It is not allowed to access a local object from outside of
its global object.
<P>
In general, an executor can run more than one global object.  A 
global object can be persistent.  A global object which has a 
persistent copy is called `persistent object'.  Each persistent 
object is saved in a file together with its local objects.  The 
object representation used here is called `object image'.  The 
file containing an object image is called `object image file'.
Object image files are stored in the following manner.
<PRE>        $OZROOT/images/000101/objects/000001
                                      000002
                                      000003
                       000102/objects/000001
                                      000002
                                        :
</PRE>
Directly below the $OZROOT/image directory, there are executor 
directories whose names are expressed in 6 hexa-decimal digits 
representing the sequential number part of the executor ID.  This
directory is called `object image directory.'  Each object image 
directory contains an `objects' directory which contains object 
image files of its persistent global objects.  The file name of
an object image file is expressed in 6 hexa-decimal digits 
representing the sequential number part of the object ID.
<P>
  In the example above, in a site whose ID is 0001, there are 
two executors whose executor IDs are:
<PRE>        0001 000101 000000
        0001 000102 000000
</PRE>
And they have objects
<PRE>        0001 000101 000001
        0001 000101 000002
        0001 000101 000003
</PRE>
and
<PRE>        0001 000102 000001
        0001 000102 000002
</PRE>
respectively.
<P>
  An object image directory can be built outside of the $OZROOT/images
directory and make a symbolic link by appropriate usage of `newimage'.
  See section 4. about it.

<P>
<b> [Invocation of `newimage']</b>
<P>
`Newimage' is an interactive tool for creating object images of an 
executor.
<P>
To invoke it, type the following nfe command:
<blockquote> nfe<b>&gt;</b> newimage
</blockquote>
<P>
Options and arguments available at the invocation time are described 
in section 4.
<P>
  `Newimage' checks the setting parameters interactively in the 
following order:
<P>
<UL><LI> class object
<LI> name directory
<LI> launcher
<LI> catalog
<LI> object manager
</UL>
<P>
Finally, the object image file is written by invoking the object 
image compiler (oic).  The process is as follows.
<P>
<b> [Detail Invocation of `newimage']</b>
<P>
 Execution of newimage <BR>
<P>
To invoke it, type the following nfe command:
<blockquote> nfe<b>&gt;</b> newimage
</blockquote>
  When `newimage' is invoked, the following error messages may be 
displayed in the output.
<blockquote> <UL>template directory ($OZROOT/lib/image-template) doesn't exist.
</UL></blockquote>
This means, the template directory cannot be found ($OZROOT will 
be substituted by an appropriate path of OZROOT).  In  this case, 
some errors are possible during installation of the OZ++ system.
  Re-install the entire system.
<P>
 Selection of configuration <BR>
<P>
When `newimage' is invoked, the following inquiry appears:
<PRE>        What kind of image do you want?
            1. Site master
            2. Station master
            3. Slave with a class object
            4. Slave without a class object
            5. Stand alone
            9. Fully customized
            0. Help
        ?
</PRE>
Standard configurations are provided in 1-5, and you can fully 
customize the configuration by selecting 9.  You can find brief 
explanations of standard configurations in 0: help.
<P>
The following sections explain full-customization.  Explanations on standard
configurations will be given in later sections.
<P>
<OL><LI> Setting of the Class Object
<P>
Setting of a class object depends on whether it is taken from 
other executors or being prepared in this executor.
<P>
<OL><LI> Preparing Class Object in this Executor<BR> 
In this case, reply `y' to:
<blockquote> Do you need a local class object for this executor (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
Then, you'll be asked:
<blockquote> What kind of class do you need (1 .. normal, 2 .. with monitor) [1] ?
</blockquote>
`With monitor' means that a window for monitoring the class 
delivery will be displayed.  Either will do.
<P>
  Next, the system inquires whether or not the class object 
should manage the `boot-classes'.
<blockquote> Does it manage boot-classes (y/n) ? 
</blockquote>
<P>
`Boot-classes' are classes of objects required to run before setting up a
development environment (The OZ++ Workbench), which can compile and add any
class (see Configuration of Management Object).
<P>
  Next, the system inquires whether or not the class object should 
be registered to the name directory.
<blockquote> Do you want to name the class object (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
  You can attach as many names as you like.
<P>
  Class objects are used from many programs such as compiler front-end 
and from other executors as described in 3.3.2.  In these cases, 
the class object is referred to by its name given here, so do 
not forget this name.  Note that different class objects cannot 
have the same name.
<P>
<LI> Employing Other Class Objects <BR> 
Although it is possible not to make a class object on an executor, 
at least one remote class object is required to provide class 
informations to the executor.
<P>
You can make a class-less executor by replying `n' to:
<blockquote> Do you need a local class object for this executor (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
Then, the following will be displayed:
<blockquote> How many remote class objects do you employee ?
</blockquote>
After inputting the appropriate number:
<blockquote> What is the name (i)
</blockquote>
will be displayed (`i' will be substituted by a number in 0-origin).
Input the name of the class object to be employed.
<P>
  Note that every class object employed in this manner must share 
the same OZROOT with this executor.  In most cases, the executor 
will be on the same station with this executor, or on executors 
on the remote stations sharing the OZROOT by some kind of remote 
file systems (e.g. NFS).  Excessive caution is required because 
`newimage' cannot check whether or not this condition is satisfied, 
and the system cannot work correctly if it is not.
</OL>
<P>
 <LI> Setting the Name Directory <BR> 
In this release, because newimage cannot configure the distribution
and the replication of the name directory system, creating more 
than one name direcotry in a domain is useless.  Thus, usually, 
only if you are building an executor which plays a central role 
in your domain, reply `y' to:
<blockquote> Do you need a local name directory (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
If you have already had a name directory in the domain, reply `n'.
<P>
<OL><LI> Making a Name Directory <BR> 
If the name directory is to be made, the following setups must 
be done.
<P>
  Since the name directory is automatically loaded by an invocation
from object manager, either will do to:
<blockquote> Do you want to preload the name directory (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
  Next, the name of the domain which is managed by the name directory 
is asked for.
<blockquote> What domain does the name directory manage ?
</blockquote>
Reply any string.  We recommend to use your DNS domain name (such as 
ipa.go.jp) because it can avoid confusion.
<P>
 <LI> Not Making a Name Directory <BR> 
In this case, the following is asked:
<blockquote> You can set an object ID as the name directory for this executor.
        Or, at the first execution of this executor, the name directory
        is searched by broadcasting.
<P>
        Do you set an object ID as the name directory (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
Either will do since the domain's name directory is automatically 
found by the broadcast  mechanism  provided by the nucleus.  If you 
reply `y', the following will be asked:
<blockquote> What is the object ID ?
</blockquote>
Input the object ID of your name directory.  The object ID of the 
name directory made by `newimage' always consists of the following:
<P>
<PRE>    site ID (4) + executor number (6) + 000003
</PRE>
(n) represents the number of hexa-decimal digits.  For example, 
the object ID of a name directory on the executor 0x101 which is 
in the site 1 will be:
<PRE>        0001000101000003
</PRE>
<P>
Or, you can reply 0000000000000000.  It is the same case as replying 
`n'.  That is, a name directory requirement message will be broadcast 
among nuclei in your site when this executor is started.
</OL>
<P>
<LI> Setups of the Launcher
<blockquote> Do you need a Launcher (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote> Do you want to preload the launcher (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
can be replied to any way you like.  However, it is usual to preload 
a launcher since  no  programs (including the launcher) can be launched 
if a launcher doesn't work on the executor.
<P>
<LI> Setups of the Catalog <BR> 
If a catalog is to be made in this executor, reply `y' to:
<blockquote> Do you need a local catalog (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
<P>
  Only one catalog can be named as `:catalog' in a domain.  In this 
release, since the newimage cannot configure the distribution and 
the replication of the catalog system, more than one catalog in a 
domain is useless.  Thus, do not create an extra catalog if you 
already have one.  It is usually enough to make a catalog on an 
executor which plays a central role in your domain.
<P>
If you create a catalog, Reply `y' to:
<blockquote> Do you want to preload the catalog (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
If you want to name the catalog, reply `y' to:
<blockquote> Do you want to name the school directory (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
<P>
  Since the workbench and launcher refers a catalog named `:catalog', 
it is usually appropriate to name it `:catalog'.
<P>
<LI> Setups of the Object Manager <BR> 
First, input your name.
<blockquote> Who are you [nnnn] ?
</blockquote>
When the environment variable $USER or $LOGNAME is not empty, 
its name will be displayed in `nnnn'.
<P>
Next, whether you are making a stand alone object manager is asked:
<blockquote> Do you make a stand alone object manager (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
A stand alone object manager does not require the other management objects
such as a name directory, and can create and run an application object.  The
details are described in section 5.5.
<P>
The next question is skipped when you are not making a stand alone object
manager:
<blockquote> Do you refer a class directory of another executor (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
The stand alone object manager can run by referring a class directory of
another executor, which allows not to create local class object and not to
employ remote class object.  The details are described in the description of
option `-r'.
<P>
Next, whether you make changes on the boot time configuration table is asked:
<blockquote> Do you make changes on the boot time configuration table (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
When you answer `y', the location of a configuration file is asked:
<blockquote> What is the file name ?
</blockquote>
Answer the  configuration  file  name.  The  details  are  description  in  the
description of option `-a'.
<P>
Next, set up the number of daemon processes.
<blockquote> Do you want to change the default number of fault daemons [2/2/0/2/1/3/2] (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
It is better to have fewer processes since they consume no small
amount of resources.  The default values are quite appropriate 
in typical cases.  The following explains the functions of the 
daemon processes, whose number is adjustable.
<UL><LI> BroadcastReceiver [2]
<P>
Receives broadcast messages.
<P>
<LI> CodeFaultDaemon [2]
<P>
When the executor requires executable code of a class, it sends the
class ID of the class to the object manager.
<P>
<LI> LayoutFaultDaemon [0]
<P>
When the executor requires layout information of a class, it sends
the class ID of the class to the object manager.  However, this
release includes only the set for Sun OS 4.1.3, so this daemon
process cannot be activated.
<P>
<LI> ClassRequestDaemon [2]
<P>
When the executor requires runtime class information of a class, it
sends the class ID of the class to the object manager.
<P>
<LI> ObjectFaultDaemon [1]
<P>
When invoking a method of a global object of FROZEN state, it sends
the object ID of the global object to the object manager.
<P>
<LI> ConfigurationDaemon [3]
<P>
When the executor requires configuration information to make an
object instance, it sends the configured class ID of the object to
the object manager.
<P>
<LI> DebuggerClassRequestDaemon [2]
<P>
When debugger requires a class, it sends the class ID to the object
manager.
</UL>
<P>
Finally,
<blockquote> Do you want to name the object manager (y/n) ?
</blockquote>
is inquired.  You can attach as many names as you like.
<P>
<LI> Available Options
<P>
`Newimage' recognizes the following options:
<P>
<DL ><DT>-n
<DD> Attach a name to this executor which is recognized by nfe.
<DT>-c
<DD> Attach a comment to this executor.
          Comments can be read by appropriate command from nfe (e.g. exidlist).
<DT>-g
<DD> Set the kind of class to `without monitor'.
<DT>-d domain-name
<DD> <BR> 
          Set the name of the domain to which this executor belongs to
          `domain-name'.
<DT>-u user-name
<DD> <BR> 
          Set the name of the owner of this executor.
<DT>-k configuration-name
<DD> <BR> 
          Use one of  the  standard  configurations.
          `Configuration-name' is one of the following:<BR> 
          <blockquote> site-master or 1<BR> 
            station-master or 2<BR> 
            slave-with-class or 3<BR> 
            slave-without-class or 4<BR> 
          </blockquote>
<P>
<DT>-o image-directory
<DD> <BR> 
          Use image-directory/<b>&lt;</b>EX-ID<b>&gt;</b> to create the object image
          directory.  The object image directory is made not under the
          $OZROOT/images directory but under the image-directory and a
          symbolic link from $OZROOT/images/<b>&lt;</b>EX-ID<b>&gt;</b> to
          image-directory/<b>&lt;</b>EX-ID<b>&gt;</b> is created.
<P>
<DT>-a configuration-file-name
<DD> <BR> 
          Use configuration-file-name as the configuration file to tell the
          object manager boot time configurations.  When creating an instance
          object, an executor asks the configured class ID to the object
          manager with the public version ID.  Usually, the object manager
          resolves it by asking to the class object.  In some cases, however,
          an object manager runs without support of class object: boot time
          and stand alone configuration.  In such cases, the object manager
          uses its internal boot time configuration table to resolve it.
          Usually, the boot time configuration table is initialized by the
          installed version of boot classes instantiated during the booting
          procedures of an object manager and a class object.  This option
          specifies a configuration file to change/add boot time
          configurations in the boot time configuration table.  The format of
          the configuration file is as following:
<P>
<PRE>    &lt;file&gt; ::= &lt;record&gt;*
    &lt;record&gt; ::= CLASS-NAME &lt;public-part&gt; &lt;configured-class&gt; '\n'
    &lt;public-part&gt; ::= OID
    &lt;configured-class&gt; ::= OID
</PRE>
          Where CLASS-NAME is a valid class name of the OZ++ language.  OID is
          16 hexa-decimal digits.  Blanks and TABs can be inserted between the
          words.  Newlines cannot be inserted except the position indiacated
          by a `\n'
.  Blank lines and lines start
          with a `#' are interpreted as comments.
<P>
<DT>-r executor-ID
<DD> <BR> 
          This option is valid for the stand-alone configuration.  For the
          stand-alone configuration, if an executor whose directory contains
          all classes used by the stand-alone executor exists in the same
          OZROOT, the stand-alone executor can run by referring the class
          directory directly.  Neither a local class object nor an employed
          remote class object is required.  This option designates the ID of
          the executor which provides its class directory to the stand-alone
          executor.  When nof such an executor is available on the same
          OZROOT, the stand-alone executor must have either a local class
          object or an employed remote class object to receive lacking
          classes.
<P>
<DT>-p
<DD> Preserves intermediate files created by `newimage'.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>

Appropriate setting of these options allows users to avoid corresponding
setting procedures in newimage.
<P>
<LI> Standard configurations
<P>
The following sections explain four kind of standard configurations.
<P>
<OL><LI> Site master
<P>
At first, one name directory and one catalog is enough to run a domain.  A
site master has these objects, and plays a central role in the domain.  To
operate the domain, the site master (or functionally equivalent executors) is
indispensable.
<P>
A site master has the following objects:
<UL><LI> An object manager <BR> 
is named &quot;:object-managers:site-master&quot;.<BR> 
The numbers of daemons are set to default numbers.
<P>
<LI> A Class Object <BR> 
is named  &quot;:classes:site-master&quot;.<BR> 
It manages the boot-classes and is preloaded. The class distribution 
monitor is enabled. Other class objects are not employed.
<P>
<LI> Name directory <BR> 
The name directory is not preloaded. It is loaded when the object manager 
is activated, searching the name directory and then activating the method.
<P>
<LI> Catalog <BR> 
Suffix &quot;:catalog&quot; is added. Catalog is not preloaded.
<P>
<LI> A launcher <BR> 
is preloaded.
</UL>
<P>
It has neither a name directory nor a catalog.
<P>
Furthermore, options for following settings can be specified. If any 
of these options are omitted, they can be specified interactively.
<P>
<UL><LI> Configuration file (option -a)
<LI> Domain name (option -d)
<LI> Owner name (option -u)
</UL>
<P>
<LI> Station master
<P>
A station needs at least one local class object which provides class
information to executors on the station, unless the station shares the 
OZROOT with other stations with certain distributed file system 
(e.g. NFS), and class information is provided from the stations. 
A station master is an executor which has a class object for 
managing boot classes. It can provide class information to 
other executors on the station and executors on other stations
sharing the OZROOT with it.  A station master cannot be stopped 
if such client executors are running.
<P>
  A station master has the following objects:
<P>
<UL><LI> An object manager <BR> 
is named &quot;:object-managers:<b>&lt;</b>EXID<b>&gt;</b>&quot;. <b>&lt;</b>EXID<b>&gt;</b> is substituted by the
sequential number part of the executor ID (6 digits starting from the
5th digit in 16 hexa-decimal digits). The numbers of daemons are set
to default numbers.
<P>
<LI> A class object <BR> 
is named &quot;:classes:<b>&lt;</b>EXID<b>&gt;</b>&quot;. It manages the boot-classes and is
preloaded. The class distribution monitor is enabled. Other class
objects are not employed.
<P>
<LI> A launcher <BR> 
is preloaded.
</UL>
<P>
  It has neither a name directory nor a catalog.
<P>
  Furthermore, options for following settings can be specified. If 
any of these options are omitted, they can be specified interactively.
<P>
<UL><LI> Configuration file (option -a)
<LI> Domain name (option -d)
<LI> Owner name (option -u)
</UL>
<P>
<LI> Slave with a class
<P>
It is not necessary for an executor to have a class object if it can get class
informations from other executors. However, you will often feel the need to
have it for efficiency. A slave with a class is an executor which has a class
object that does not manage the boot-classes.
<P>
A slave with a class is the same as a station master except that the class
object doesn't manage the boot-classes.
<P>
<LI> Slave without a class
<P>
A slave without a class is an executor which doesn't have a class object.
Class information is provided from remote class objects.  It is the same as a
slave with a class except that it doesn't have a class object.  Furthermore, a
slave without a class can employ remote class objects.  Class objects to be
employed can be set interactively by `newimage'.
<P>
<LI> Stand alone
<P>
An executor which can run without any other objects.  That is, a site master
or a station master is not required to run this executor.  However, if the
application itself requires another object, e.g. a name directory or a
catalog, running them is necessary.  Class objects are not required if a
condition is met.  That is, since class files are required in runtime, if a
class object which has all classes required by the stand alone executor exists
on the same OZROOT, the executor, by directly referring its class directory,
can run with neither creating new class object nor employing a remote class
object.  If such a class object does not exist, even the stand alone executor
must have a class object locally ore on remote.
<UL><LI> A stand alone object manager<BR> 
      is named ``:object-managers:<b>&lt;</b>EXID<b>&gt;</b>''.  <b>&lt;</b>EXID<b>&gt;</b> is substituted by
      the sequential number part of the executor ID (6 digits starting from
      the 5th digit in 16 hexa-decimal digits).  The numbers of daemons are
      set to default numbers.
</UL>
There is no other object.
<P>
Furthermore, options for following settings can be specified.  If any of these
options are omitted, they can be specified interactively.
<UL><LI> Configuration file (option -a)
<LI> Domain name (option -d)
<LI> Owner name (option -u)
</UL>
There is no Launcher for the stand alone executor.  Instead of the Launcher,
the stand alone object manager can create and run an application object.  This
object is created as a global object.  And its class must be a subclass of
class Startable.  The class must define a following public method:
<blockquote> void Initialize(): global
</blockquote>
The method Initialize is called once just after the creation.  As well as the
usual global object, method Go isn't called when the creation, and succeeding
starting-up of this executor calls Go, not Initialize.
<P>
The stand alone object manager opens a dialog window after start-up.  By this
window, you can set up an application object.
<P>
At first, a configuration file is asked:
<blockquote> Configuration File [none]:
</blockquote>
If the configuration file specified at newimage time has enough information,
you can simply type return to this question.  Otherwise, additional
configuration file can be specified.  If the specified file doesn't exist, the
same question will be repeated.
<P>
Next, the configured class ID of the application object to be created is
asked:
<blockquote> Configured Class ID:
</blockquote>
16 hexa-decimal digits are required.  Any other answer causes a repeated
question.  Correct answer creates the object and calls the method Initialize.
If the created object is made permanent during its execution, the next
starting-up of this executor simply executes the object and doesn't ask the
configured class ID to create an object.  If the permanent object is removed
during the execution, again a configured class ID is asked next time.
<P>
After successful creation of an application object, the object is started to
run.  However, if the configuration file doesn't have enough information,
following question is asked:
<blockquote> Configured Class ID for xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:
</blockquote>
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is a public version ID of a class.  Answer the configured
class ID.

<LI> Error Messages of oic
<P>
In case of abnormalities in the setups and installations, there are 
times, although very rare, when the object image compiler `oic' 
outputs an error message. In these cases, not much can be done by 
the user. However, he/she can check the following.
<P>
<UL><LI> Is the `sb' running properly?
<P>
From the command line, type
<blockquote> % sb Class 0
</blockquote>
and check if 16 hexa-decimal  digits  are  displayed.
<P>
If `sb' is not running properly, it is possible that a school 
file for the boot classes `$OZROOT/etc/boot-school' has not 
been installed properly. In this case, it is better to re-install 
the OZ++ system and take notice of error messages from it.
<P>
<LI> Is the Makefile.oibuild installed properly?
<P>
  Check if `$OZROOT/lib/Makefile.oibuild' exists and make sure that 
its size is not zero.
</UL>
<P>
<LI> Interruption of `Newimage'
<P>
 If `newimage' is interrupted by `SIGHUP', `SIGINT', or `SIGTERM', 
the directory containing the object image file is completely erased. 
If `newimage' is to be interrupted without erasing this directory, 
use `SIGQUIT' (which is ^\ from terminals).
