Project <BR>
<P>
<OL><LI> The project is a name space which can register Launchable objects.
Launchable offers a tree structure of the projects, starting from /(root).
<P>
<LI> Users can freely make out subprojects under the root project.  Refer to
Tutorial A for the detailed method.
<P>
<LI> Launcher has only a current project, which is displayed in the current
project view.
<P>
<LI> Subprojects of the current project are displayed in the Subproject list.
By double-clicking, the clicked project can be changed to the subproject.
<P>
<LI>  The moving of projects other than the above mentioned projects (the
alteration of the current project) are done by the &quot;Project&quot; menu.<BR> 
By clicking &quot;Up,&quot; the projects are moved to the parent project of the
now current projects.
</OL>
<P>
Package <BR>
<P>
Programs that can be executed by Launcher are registered in a global
object called a catalog with a unit called a package.  To execute programs
from Launcher, it is first necessary to copy the packages from the catalog.
<P>
The package list displays the registered packages.
<P>
As the package is registered as the name of the catalog, it is unable
to import the more than two identical packages on the same project.
<P>
Launchable object <BR>
<P>
To execute the programs, it is necessary to convert the packages
registered in the Launcher to the Launcher object.  This operation is done
by double-clicking the item of the package list (Tutorial C).  The names
input here are those displayed from Launcher.  These names have to be unique
in the projects, and can not be the same as the name of a subproject or a
package.
<P>
The Launcher object list displays the generated Launcher object, and
this method is executed by double-clicking.
<P>
Edit Function <BR>
<P>
Moving and Deleting of the subprojects, Launcher objects and packages
are done by the Edit menu.
<UL><LI> The items the users want to move or delete are selected with the mouse.
<LI> From the menu, select Move and Delete.
<LI> The necessary items are entered in the dialog box.
</UL>
<P>
When they are moved, the goal projects to be copied must already exist.
<P>
The root project can not be moved or deleted.
