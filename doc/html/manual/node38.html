 <A NAME=langlangmanualconstructor>&#160;</A>
<P>
Constructor is a special method invoked when a instance of an ordinary class or
static class is created.  
Generally, it has the function for initialization of an instance.
<P>
When it defines that both the instanciation and initialization of an instance 
are separated, and initialization is done by an ordinary method, 
the following problem occurs.
<P>
<UL><LI>  No other method should be executed to the object between the instanciation
and initialization of an instance because they are a series of operations.  
As long as this operation is divided into two parts, however, the language 
can not control it.
</UL>
<P>
OZ++ language solves this problem to execute the instanciation and initialization of an instance as one operation by introducing the constructor.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000618100000000000000>5.18.1 Feature</A></H3>
<P>
The constructor of OZ++ language has the following features.
<P>
<OL><LI>  It is possible to have any number of parameters.
<LI>  It is possible to define a multiple constructor in one ordinary class 
or static class.
<LI>  The constructor is defined as a method whose return value is <tt> void</tt>.
<LI>  It is possible to reserve the constructor by access control 
(see Sections <A HREF="node33.html#langlangmanualclassaccesscontrol">5.13.3</A> and 
<A HREF="node34.html#langlangmanualstaticclassaccesscontrol">5.14.3</A>).
<P>
</OL>
<P>
With the exception of the above features, it is not different from the 
ordinary method with regard to definition, and it is a method of reserved 
<tt> constructor</tt> by access control.
<P>
When the constructor is called, however, it is always requested to perform 
a special process such as the generation of an instance.  
In doing this, it is questionable to describe it as the ordinary 
method invocation.  
In OZ++, the instance can not be created by automatic calling of 
a constructor when the class type variable is stated as in C++.  
The instance variable of class type itself has no reference to the instance
after instanciation, 
so the reference to the instance created by invoking  constructor 
to the variable and housed to the variable.  
Thus, the calling of a constructor in OZ++ has two special features:
<P>
<UL><LI>  Special process for the generation of an instance
<P>
<LI>  Invocation of a method even when the instance does not exist.
</UL>
<P>
Thus, because of the language distinction, it should be described as follows:
<P>
<PRE>class A {
  constructor: m1, m2;

  void m1(int a) { ... }

  void m2() { ... }
};

A a, b;

a=&gt;m1(10); // a constructor call
b=&gt;m2();     // a constructor call
</PRE>
<P>
In OZ++, the generation of global object on the other executors is essential
to program the distributed application using networks.  
To do this, an executor where the global object will be instantiated can 
be specified
as an option of the constructor invocation.  
More concretely, it should be declared that the object manager abstracting 
an executor as an object of OZ++, and be described as follows:
<P>
<PRE>global A a;
global ObjectManager om = Where ();

a=&gt;m1 (10)@om;
</PRE>
<P>
Furthermore, the programmer should define the constructor even if it do only 
a zero clear of the instance variable.  
Such constructor can be described with null block as follows:
<P>
<PRE>class A {
  constructor: new;

  void new() {}
}
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000618200000000000000>5.18.2 Inheritance of Constructor</A></H3>
<P>
In C++ language, when the instance of child class is generated, the constructor
of the parent class is called automatically after the constructor of the class 
is called.  
In this way, however, a programmer should be conscious of the call order 
of constructors along with the inheritance tree which does not appear directly 
in programs.
<P>
In OZ++ language, it does not  automatically call the constructor of the parent 
class. 
The constructor defined by the parent class can also be inherited as an ordinary 
method in the child class.  
Thus, in the child class, the user can select whether to invoke the constructor 
of the parent class as an ordinary method or to utilize the constructor in 
the child class by access control reserving.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000618300000000000000>5.18.3 Multiple Calling of Constructor</A></H3>
<P>
<PRE>A a;

a=&gt;m1(10);
... 
a=&gt;m1(20);
</PRE>
<P>
In the second invocation of the constructor in above example, the reference 
to the instance referred with <tt> a</tt> until then is discarded and 
the reference to the newly generated instance is saved to <tt> a</tt>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000618400000000000000>5.18.4 Generation of Instance</A></H3>
<P>
The constructor described above has functions which initialize an instance 
after generating the instance on memory.  
In short, the area for instance is reserved on memory and the area of instance 
variables is zero cleared before execution of the constructor. 
In OZ++, this part of the process is hidden from the user and uses need not to 
concern about memory management.
<P>
The memory management process which involves securing of memory area for the 
instance and so on is executed by an executor.  
The heap called cell is generated on each unit of global objects, and 
a process like paging is executed on each cell unit.  
Furthermore, a local object kept by a global object is generated in a cell.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000618500000000000000>5.18.5 Deleting Instance</A></H3>
<P>
In OZ++, it is impossible to describe directly the program for deleting 
the local object.  
The local object is deleted tacitly by GC when it is not referred.  
On the other hand, it is possible to cut the chain of the reference to 
instance of the variable by putting 0 (zero) instead of the reference to 
the instance of class.  
Accordingly, the local object is enabled to delete indirectly because 
the following step of execution of GC deletes the local object to avoid 
all references by putting 0 (zero) instead of the variable referring to 
the local object.  
However, there is no clear way to execut GC.
<P>
The global object can be deleted by utilizing the service of the object 
manager managing that global object.
