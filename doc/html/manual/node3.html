<P>
 <H2><A NAME=SECTION00021000000000000000>1.1 A guideline to introduce and operate OZ++</A></H2>
<P>
This section shows a guideline to introduce the OZ++ system and operate it
using the internet, mainly showing the reference point in this document.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00021100000000000000>1.1.1 Trial installation</A></H3>
<P>
To try the OZ++ at first, the following steps will be simple and useful:
<OL><LI> Install the OZ++ system.
<LI> Configure the nucleus.
<LI> Start the nucleus.
<LI> Configure the site-master.
<LI> Start the site-master.
</OL>
<P>
Installation <BR>
<P>
To install the OZ++ system, follow the instructions listed in the file <tt>
INSTALL</tt> included in the release package.  By the installation, the OZROOT
directory is made and the executable binaries are obtained.
<P>
Configuring the nucleus <BR>
<P>
To configure easily, it is enough to add the following line to the nucleus
table file <tt> $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table</tt>:
<blockquote> <tt> EXIDMANAGE:<i> hostname</i>:</tt>
</blockquote>
The <i> hostname</i> should be replaced by the name of your machine.
<P>
The details of the nucleus configuration are given in the section 2.1
``Structure of OZ++ distributed objects'' in this document and the file <tt>
doc/README.nucleus</tt> included in this release package.  In brief, this line
sets the nucleus at <i> hostname</i> as the executor-ID management nucleus.
<P>
Starting the nucleus <BR>
<P>
The nucleus is started by the command <tt> ncl</tt>.  (Include the <tt>
$OZROOT/bin/</tt> in the PATH.)  When starting a nucleus, if the other nucleus is 
running in the same LAN, they may interfere each other.  It can be avoided by
giving a random number as an argument of the -p option of the <tt> ncl</tt>.  The
details are described in the file <tt> doc/README.nucleus</tt> included in this
release package.
<P>
Configuring the site-master <BR>
<P>
The site-master is suitable as the first executor you make because it can be
started by itself and has most of the functionalities the OZ++ distributed
object management system can provide.  After successful starting of the
nucleus, its functions can be invoked through the command <tt> nfe</tt> (Nucleus
Front-End).  A site-master can be created by typing the following command to
the nfe:
<blockquote> <tt> newimage -k site-master -n <i> name</i> -c <i> comment</i> -d <i> domain</i> -u
<i> user</i></tt>
</blockquote>
To use the site-master as a trial, it is enough to give meaningless words for
the <i> name</i>, <i> comment</i>, <i> domain</i> and <i> user</i>.  After that, you
will be asked as following:
<blockquote> <tt> Do you make changes on the boot time configuration table (y/n) ? </tt>
</blockquote>
Answer <tt> n</tt> to it.  Then a site-master will be created after a few minutes
later.  The details of image creation are described in the section 2.2 ``How
to make images.''  The successful creation of the site-master can be confirmed 
by the command <tt> exidlist</tt> of the <tt> nfe</tt>.
<P>
Starting the site-master <BR>
<P>
An executor can be started by the command <tt> cex</tt> of the <tt> nfe</tt>.  The
newly created site-master can be invoked by the following command:
<blockquote> <tt> cex $<i> name</i></tt>
</blockquote>
The <i> name</i> should be replaced by the <i> name</i> parameter given at the
creation time.  It takes a few minutes to start the site-master at the first
time.  The start-up procedure ends with showing the Launcher window.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00021200000000000000>1.1.2 Writing OZ++ programs</A></H3>
<P>
The language specification is described in section 5 ``Supplements: OZ++
Language Specification'' in this document.  The OZ++ programs must be compiled
before the execution.  The compilation of them can be done by the OZ++
workbench: the development environment of OZ++.  Since the detailed
explanations of the OZ++ workbench are described in section 3 ``Environment
for OZ++ Program Development'' in this document, this section only describes
the way to create the OZ++ workbench at first time.
<P>
Select the item ``Object'' from the menu ``Create'' of the Launcher, and type
the public ID of the class WorkbenchLaunchable.  The public ID of the
WorkbenchLaunchable can be obtained by following manner:
<blockquote> <tt>
% cfed<BR> 
sb WorkbenchLaunchable 1<BR> 
0001000002000414<BR> 
quit<BR> 
%</tt>
</blockquote>
The <tt> 0001000002000414</tt> is the public ID of the WorkbenchLaunchable.  To
avoid repeating this rather awkward procedure, it is recommended to register
the WorkbenchLaunchable to the Catalog using the just created workbench.
The detailed explanations of the Launcher usage are described in section 2.3
``Launcher'' in this document.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00021300000000000000>1.1.3 To use the OZ++ system in a site</A></H3>
<P>
To configure the OZ++ system to be used by the multiple users in a site,
following steps will be suitable:
<OL><LI> Configuring the nucleus to be operated in the site-wide system
<LI> Configuring the site-master to be shared
<LI> Configuring the individual environment of each user
</OL>
<P>
Configuring the site-wide nucleus <BR>
<P>
Nucleus table (<tt> $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table</tt>) must be configured
appropriately and released to public.  It is necessary to specify the
executor-ID management nucleus.  Moreover, the configuration of the half
routers must be specified unless all the machines are connected to the same
LAN segment.  The detailed explanations of the nucleus table configuration are
described in section 2.1 ``Structure of OZ++ distributed objects'' in this
document and the file <tt> doc/README.nucleus</tt> in this release package.  To
make things simple, nuclei started to be operated as a part of the site-wide
OZ++ system should not be given the -p option.  By this, a user willing to
start a nucleus independent from the site-wide system can start it with the -p
option.  It never interfere the site-wide system.
<P>
Configuring the site-master to be shared <BR>
<P>
The site-master should be configured in the following manner:
<UL><LI> Specify the privileged user as the owner<BR> 
      Although the privileged user can be named as your choice, it is
      recommended to give an apparently distinguishable name, such as oz++,
      root, and the like.
<LI> Give the DNS domain name of your domain as the domain name.
</UL>
After the successful start up, it is recommended to register the
WorkbenchLaunchable to your catalog for the convenience of the users.
<P>
Once the site-master is started, it is shared by the users.  Thus, be careful
with the shutdown.
<P>
Configuring the individual environment <BR>
<P>
Individual environment should be build without the site-master.
Note that:
<UL><LI> Do not use the same user name for different users.<BR> 
      Manager of the site should assign the unique user name for each user.
<LI> Specify the domain name same as that of the site-master.
</UL><H3><A NAME=SECTION00021400000000000000>1.1.4 To use objects over the Internet</A></H3>
<P>
To use objects over the internet, your site must have an unique site-id and an
application gateway running.  To satisfy these, following steps are required:
<UL><LI> Acquiring the site ID
<LI> Configuring the application gateway
</UL>
<P>
Acquiring the site ID <BR>
<P>
Send the following mail to the <tt> oz++admin@oz.ipa.go.jp</tt>:
<blockquote> <tt>
To: oz++admin@oz.ipa.go.jp<BR> 
From: <i> your address</i><BR> 
Subject: [Site ID Request]<BR> 
<BR> 
Organization: <i> your organization</i><BR> 
Domain: <i> your DNS domain name</i><BR> 
Gateway: <i> your firewall machine on which OZ++'s application gateway works</i></tt>
</blockquote>
The site ID will be issued and replied.  Set it to the file <tt>
$OZROOT/etc/site-id</tt>.
<P>
Note that the executors and classes created prior to rewriting the site-id
cannot be used after it.  You must re-create a site-master and
station-masters, and re-compile classes.
<P>
Configuring the application gateway <BR>
<P>
Despite of whether the firewall exists or not, the application gateway is
required to use the Internet by OZ++.  How to configure the application
gateway is described in section 2.6 ``Application Gateway'' in this document.
