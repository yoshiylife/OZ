<P>

Blocks are used to allow compound statements in places where only one
statement is written, and vice versa, i.e. a single statement can be
used where only one is required (see Chapter
<A HREF="node30.html#langlangmanualstatement">5.10</A>).
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00063200000000000000>5.3.2 Scopes</A></H3>
<P>
Scope in OZ++ language is lexical scope, it is determined statically
during compilation.
<P>
There are four types of scopes:  local, class, static class, and record.
<P>
<UL><LI> Local Scope<BR> 
A name declared inside a block is local to that block.  The name is
valid only inside the block.
<P>
Names of call by value parameters of operators and methods are,
however, treated as those names that are declared in the outermost
block.
<P>
Only names of variables can be declared in a block.

<P>
<LI> Class Scope<BR> 
This refers to the scope of a class.  The user-defined type (see
Chapter <A HREF="node25.html#langlangmanualusertype">5.5</A>) used here is local to the
scope.
<P>
The names of class members are also local to this class, and can be
used in the following places:
<P>
<OL><LI> Inside the method of the class
<P>
<LI> In case of a method, below the operator <tt> -&gt;</tt> applied to
      objects of the class or child classes inheriting the class

<P>
<LI> Inside the methods of the child classes inheriting the class.
</OL>
<P>
To make 2 and 3 possible, appropriate access control must be made (see
Chapter <A HREF="node33.html#langlangmanualclass">5.13</A>).  
<P>
<LI> Static Class Scope
<P>
This refers to the scope of a static class.  The user-defined type
(see Chapter <A HREF="node25.html#langlangmanualusertype">5.5</A>) used here is local to
the scope.
<P>
The names of static class members are also local to the class, and can be used in the following places:
<P>
<OL><LI> Inside the the method of the static class
<P>
<LI> In case of a method, below the operator
 <tt> -&gt;</tt> applied to objects of the static class 
</OL>
<P>
To make 2 possible, appropriate access control must be
performed (see Chapter <A HREF="node34.html#langlangmanualstaticclass">5.14</A>). 
<P>
<LI>  Record Scope<BR> 
This refers to the scope of a record.  The user-defined type (see
Chapter <A HREF="node25.html#langlangmanualusertype">5.5</A>) used here is local to the
scope.
<P>
The names of record members are also local to this record, and can be
used in the following places:
<P>
<OL><LI> Inside the operator of this record
<P>
 <LI> After the operator <tt> .</tt> applied to the objects of this record
</OL></UL>
<P>
Names are sometimes hidden by the scope which contains them.
<P>
<PRE>class D : A {
  public: m1;

  int x, y;
  B b;
  C c;

  void m1 (int x)
    {
      int y, i;        

      y = x;
      for (i = 0; i &lt; y; i++)
       {
          int x;

          x +=  y * i;
       }
    }        
}
</PRE>
<P>
In the above example,<tt> A</tt>,<tt> B</tt>,<tt> C</tt>, and <tt> D</tt> are four
user-defined types which type names are local to the scope of class
<tt> D</tt>.
<P>
In method <tt> m1</tt>, <tt> y</tt> is declared locally, and <tt> x</tt> is
declared as a argument.  Thus, the instance variables <tt> x</tt> and <tt>
y</tt> become hidden.  Also, as x is locally declared in <tt> for</tt>
statement, the instance variable <tt> x</tt> of method becomes hidden.  If
local declarations become hidden in this way, they can not be
accessed.
