<P>
  A guide line is presented for indicating which function should be assigned 
to which machine at a site and how to set it appropriately when OZ++ is used. 
  The OZ++ system performs calculations by operating on objects on the
executive system known as an executor.  The executor cannot operate by
itself, so it is necessary to have a nucleus that can manage the executor
existing on each machine and supply basic functions such as communication
etc.  There are several types of nucleus suitable for these roles.
Therefore, it becomes necessary to make available the proper nucleus.
To enable the communication among sites, it is necessary to lay out the
application gateway which relays the nucleus communication.  The same
applies to objects.  That is, not only the user object but also the
management object supporting the user object should be placed at the
proper position in the site.
<P>
 In this document, the system configuration is presented.  Also, the
layout of the nucleus and management objects in the system are described.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00031200000000000000>2.1.2 Configuration of Nucleus</A></H3>
<P>
Configuration of OZ++ Site <BR>
<P>
The configuration of the OZ++ system is as follows:
<P>
<UL><LI> Site <BR> 
An OZ++ world is the range which can be accessed in the OZ++ system.
An OZ++ world is composed of more than one site.
<P>
<LI> Segment <BR> 
A range in which a physical broadcast can be performed is called a
segment.  A segment is comprised of more than one station belonging to
the same physical segment.  To enable a broadcast to be performed
between segments of the same site, a halfrouter nucleus (described
later) is set on each segment.
<P>
The logical broadcast is one that is performed over segments through
the relay of the halfrouter nucleus, as shown in Figure <A HREF="node5.html#figoz_system">2.1--1</A>.
<P>
<LI> Station <BR> 
This is a computer.  One nucleus and more than 0 executors should be
set on each station.

</CENTER>

<P>
Layout of a Nucleus <BR>
<P>
  There are some nuclei which play special roles in the site, and it is
very important to lay them out properly.
  The layout of these nuclei is set by registering them in a text file
called the nucleus table.  Please see set up of nucleus for an
explanation of nucleus.
<P>
<OL><LI> Executor ID Management Nucleus <BR> 
  The executor which carries and executes the object is identified by a
unique ID at the site.  This ID is called an executor ID.  The executor ID
management nucleus is one that performs centralized management for the
creation of the executor.  The new executor ID is obtained from the
executor ID management nucleus, to ensure the impartment of the unique
executor ID at the site.
<P>
  Be sure to set only one executor ID management nucleus at a site.  It is
necessary for the nucleus, to be operational at all times and so it should
be started on a station that is working continuously.
<P>
<LI> Halfrouter Nucleus <BR> 
  The nucleus relaying the physical broadcast is called a halfrouter nucleus
(refer to Fig. <A HREF="node5.html#figoz_system">2.1--1</A>).
<P>
  When the site is composed of several segments, it is necessary to set one
halfrouter nucleus in each segment.
</OL><H3><A NAME=SECTION00031300000000000000>2.1.3 Configuration of Management Object</A></H3>
<P>
  A series of objects is prepared in OZ++ to provide the necessary functions
for the user object operation.  These objects are called a distributed
object management system in summary.  To operate the user object, it is
necessary to properly lay out the management object.  The name and outline
of each management object are shown as follows.
<P>
<UL><LI> Object Manager <BR> 
Only one object manager is required for each executor.
It manages the state of global object on the executor.
It has global object functions such as generation, stop, deletion, pause,
etc.
<P>
<LI> Class Object <BR> 
Generally, one class object is required for each station.
It manages classes (executable code etc.)
The executor needs a class of object to be operated on it.
The class takes on the function of this supplying.
<P>
If a class without self-management is required, the requirement is
transmitted through a network and supplied to the executor after the
class delivery is received by the class object which manages the class.
<P>
<LI> Name Directory <BR> 
Only one name directory is required in a domain (to be described later).
It assigns a name to a global object, so that the global object can be
referred to by its name.
<P>
<LI> Catalog <BR> 
Only one catalog is required in a domain.
It assigns names for the open application and class library, and then
stores them.
<P>
As a management object needs another management object to control its
operation, an object image including a management object must be created
at the beginning.  The newimage is provided as a tool for creating the
object image of the management object.  Produce the image with the use
of this tool.  The method of using this tool is written in
explanation of newimage.
</UL>
<P>
Domain <BR>
<P>
  The management objects described above are registered under the following
names in the name directory.
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD>Class object</TD> <TD></TD> <TD>":classes:xxxxxx"</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Name directory</TD> <TD></TD> <TD>":name"</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Catalog</TD>           <TD></TD> <TD>":catalog"</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

In the case of newimage unless otherwise specified, xxxxxx is filled in with
six digits that comprise the ID sequence number part of the executor where the
class object exists.  If the executor ID is 0001001402000000, the six digits
are 001402.
<P>
  The name space of an object created by the name directory, such as that
shown above, is called a domain.  The previous section states that only one
name directory and only one catalog are required in a domain.  This means
that there are objects corresponding to &quot;:name&quot; and &quot;:catalog&quot; and they have
to play the roles of name directory and catalog.
<P>
  You can build any number of domains in site, but each of them must has a
name directory and a catalog.
<P>
Characteristics of Management Object <BR>
<P>
When various objects are laid out, various characteristics are shown.
<P>
<OL><LI>  Object Manager <BR> 
  Only one object manager can be created in each executor.
<P>
<LI> Class Object <BR> 
  The class object can supply the classes not only for the executor on which
it exists, but also for other executors sharing a common OZROOT.  Therefore,
it is possible for each OZROOT to actuate the overall system as long as at
least one class object operates.  Usually, since the OZROOT is made by each
station, it is believed that the class object is also required for each
station.  However, when OZROOT is shared according to NFS, etc., it is
feasible to have only one class object at least for the group of stations.
<P>
  Since the OZROOT without class object is disabled from operating, it is
necessary to hold the class objects for those executors that may not be
started at the same time.  Otherwise, it is desirable to prepare an executor
which is always running and to set a class object on this executor.
<P>
<UL><LI> Preload Class and Boot Class <BR> 
  The object manager and class object should operate even when there is no
class object to provide classes for the executor.  Therefore, the classes
necessary for the operation must be designated with a special &quot;preload class&quot;
to ensure that the classes are supplied properly even when no class object
exists.
<P>
  However, it is impossible to operate the user object in practice, unless
the name directory and catalog necessary for the domain operation as well as
the classes used to actuate the launcher (refer to &quot;README.launcher&quot;) etc.
required for starting the application operation are provided.  These classes
needed for the basic objects are supplied as a boot class.  Whether or not the
boot class is managed by a class object is specified when the class object is
created with the newimage.
<P>
  The boot class of a non-preload class is different from the preload class.
  It can not be supplied to the executor until it is managed properly by a
class object.
<P>
  Then, is the class object which does not manage the boot class worth
nothing?  This is not the case.  For classes without self-management, the
class object can be delivered from other class objects on the network.
However, this operation can be performed only by the preload class.
Therefore, it is necessary to create a class object which does not manage the
boot class, so as to receive the delivery of classes in sequence and supply
the classes to the executor at the same time.  (In this case, there must
exist a class object managing the boot class somewhere on the network.)
</UL>
<P>
<LI> Name Directory <BR> 
  Be sure to create only one name directory in a domain.
<P>
  Since a domain without a name directory can not operate, create one on the
executor which is always working at your site.
<P>
<LI> Catalog <BR> 
  Be sure to create only one catalog in a domain.
<P>
  It is very difficult to start the OZ++ program in a domain without a catalog
.
  The catalog should be set on the same executor as the name directory, and
it should be operated at all times.
</OL>
<P>
Layout of Management Object <BR>
<P>
  A guideline is presented to show how to lay out each management object in
a better way.
<P>
<OL><LI> Site Master <BR> 
  Create the site master<A NAME=tex2html1 HREF="footnode.html#646">[+]</A> first.  Choose a station which is running
continuously and create an executor which is also working continuously as
far as possible.  It should include the following:
<UL><LI> Object manager
<LI> Class object (managing boot class)
<LI> Name directory
<LI> Catalog
<LI> Launcher 
</UL>
<P>
  A simple procedure for creating the site master is prepared in newimage and
the executor which has all the objects needed for the site master is easy to
create using this procedure<A NAME=tex2html2 HREF="footnode.html#649">[+]</A>.
<P>
  A site master created with a diffusion source is included in this release.
In addition to the boot class, various class libraries used for the OZ++ user
and a lot of classes required for demonstration are registered in the class
object and catalog on this site master.  This site master should be tried at
the beginning is suggested.
<P>
<LI> Station Master <BR> 
  Several site masters can not be created at one domain.  Then, what kind of
executor is it better to create in the station after the second?  It should
include the following:
<UL><LI> Object manager
<LI> Class object (managing boot class)
<LI> Launcher
</UL>
  In this case, the operation until the launcher starts can be performed
locally only with this station.  If there are other necessary classes,
delivery can be received at another place.  An executor configured in this
way is known as a station master.  It is possible to create several station
masters in one station.
<P>
  A simple procedure for creating a station master is prepared in newimage,
and an executor which has all the objects written above is easy to create
using the procedure.
<P>
<LI> Slave with Class Object <BR> 
  An executor holding a class object which delivers all the classes including
the boot class from outside can be created, so that it can take the place of
a station master.  This kind of executor is called a slave with class objects.
It holds the following objects.
<UL><LI> Object manager
<LI> Class object (does not manage boot class)
<LI> Launcher
</UL>
  A simple procedure for creating a slave with class objects is prepared in
newimage and an executor which has all the objects written above is easy to
create using the procedure.
<P>
<LI> Slave without Class Objects <BR> 
  What kind of object should be laid out to create an executor after the
second on the station where the site master and the station master have been
created?  It should include the following:
<UL><LI> Object manager
<LI> Launcher
</UL>
  Class objects in the existing site master and the station master are used.
<P>
A simple procedure for creating a slave without class objects is prepared in
the newimage and the executor which has all the objects written above is easy
to create using the procedure.
</OL>
<P>
Creating Method of Management Object <BR>
<P>
  The management objects are created with a tool called newimage.  The
method of using this tool is written in explanation of newimage.
