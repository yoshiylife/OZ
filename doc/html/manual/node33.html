<P>
A class is one of user-defined types.  It is made up of instance
variables (i.e. the internal representation of class instances) and
definitions of methods applicable to the instances.  Class members are
instance variables and methods defined in a class.
<P>
The size of a class instance having no class members consumes non-zero
memory blocks.  In addition, multiple inheritance can be used in the
definition of a class (see Chapter
<A HREF="node37.html#langlangmanualinheritance">5.17</A>).
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000613100000000000000>5.13.1 Class Name</A></H3>
<P>
A class name is a reserved word in the scope of the class's definition.
<P>
<PRE>class C {
  A a;    // an instance variable of type class A
  B b;    // an instance variable of type class B
}
</PRE>
<P>
A class also represents a type.
Different classes represent different types.
As mentioned later (see Chapter <A HREF="node37.html#langlangmanualinheritance">5.17</A>),
a class instance can not be assigned to a variable of a different
class type which is not a ancestor class
(see Section <A HREF="node26.html#langlangmanualtypeexchangeconsistency">5.6.2</A>).

<P>
Inside the class definition, class members of the same name must not
be declared more than twice.  Also overloading of methods, as
C++ language, are not possible.
<P>
<PRE>class C {
  int m() { ... }        
  int m(int p) { ... }   // error: the class member m
}                        //  is already declared
</PRE>
<P>
Initialization can not be performed in the declaration of instance
variables.
<P>
<PRE>class C {
  int a = 10;   // error: initial setups can not be performed
}
</PRE>
<P>
If methods having no <tt> m_quals</tt> are
executed, 
they become local
methods and are executed as local accesses.
<P>

An access which is performed only inside the same cell is called a
local access (as shown by the dotted lines in
Fig.<A HREF="node33.html#figlanglangmanualclassmethod">5.13--1</A>).
As mentioned in Chapter <A HREF="node25.html#langlangmanualusertype">5.5</A>,
a cell consists of a set of class instances,
one global object and local objects belongs to that global one.
For this reason, local accesses, which are performed inside the same
cell, require no access through the network.
Thus, local accesses are method activations which are
performed in the same computer.
<P>
Methods to which <tt> m_quals</tt> are added have the following
properties as specified by <tt> m_quals</tt>:
<P>
<UL><LI> <tt> global</tt>
<P>
If the method is activated, this is the global method executed as a
global access.
<P>

A global access is performed against global objects
both inside and outside the cell
(as shown by the thick lines in Fig.<A HREF="node33.html#figlanglangmanualclassmethod">5.13--1</A>).
<P>
Since local objects in other cells can not be used directly, all the
outside cells are accessed as global access.
Therefore, only the global methods defined in the global
objects can be used to access objects in other cells.
<P>
In addition to the local objects mentioned above, global methods
of the global object inside the same cell can be invoked.
In this case, local objects of the parameters are not references,
and copies of local objects are executed.
The user must carefully note this fact.
<P>
Global accesses are performed as method invocations against external
cells on the network.  However, in case of global accesses to the
global object in the same cell, the network is not used.
<P>
<LI> <tt> locked</tt>
<P>
This specifies an exclusive control on the invocation of the methods.
<P>
Instances generated from a class having at least one <tt> locked</tt> method
are called <b> monitors</b>.
<P>
<LI> <tt> abstract</tt>
<P>
This specifies that the method is an abstract one
(see Section <A HREF="node33.html#langlangmanualclassabstract">5.13.6</A>).

<P>
The definition of a class specifies whether or not each class member is open to 
the outside.  Hereafter, if a class is used as a variable type, it is also 
called a client class.
<P>
The following three specifications are possible for access control of class 
members.
<P>
<UL><LI> <tt> public</tt>
<P>
If the class is used as a client class, the class members are opened to enable 
method invocations against instances.
<P>
If the class is inherited, the methods it specifies can be used in the child 
classes (see Chapter <A HREF="node37.html#langlangmanualinheritance">5.17</A>).
<P>
<tt> public</tt> can only be specified to methods.
<P>
<LI> <tt> protected</tt>
<P>
If the class is used as a client class, it is not open.  Method
invocations against its instances are not possible.
<P>
If the class is inherited, similar to methods where <tt> public</tt> is
specified, the class members it specifies is accessible in the
child classes (see Chapter <A HREF="node37.html#langlangmanualinheritance">5.17</A>).
<P>
<tt> protected</tt> can be specified to all class members.
<P>
<LI> <tt> constructor</tt>
<P>
Methods used for instance generation are specified in the constructor (see 
Chapter <A HREF="node38.html#langlangmanualconstructor">5.18</A>).
<P>
Methods specifying constructors must have return values of the <tt> void</tt> type.
<P>
If the class is inherited, its methods are treated as any other ordinary 
methods.
</UL>
<P>
Class members for which access control is not specified become <tt>
private</tt>, and if they are used as client classes, they can not be
accessed from outside the class.
If the class is inherited, it cannot be used in child
classes (see Chapter <A HREF="node37.html#langlangmanualinheritance">5.17</A>).
<P>
<PRE>class C {
  public: m1, m2; 
  protected: m3;  
  constructor: create, create2; 
   // error: the type of return value of create2() is not void.
  int m1() { ... }
  int m2() { ... }
  int m3() { ... }
  int m4() { ... }  // since there are no specifications,
                    // it is considered as private.
  void create() { ... }
  int create2() { ... } 
}
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000613400000000000000>5.13.4 self</A></H3>
 <A NAME=langlangmanualclassself>&#160;</A>
<P>
Instances which are to be executed in a method can be referred
by the reserved word <tt> self</tt>.  Therefore, in the following
<P>
<PRE>class C {
  int m1() { ... }
  int m2() { ... }
}
</PRE>
<P>
when the method <tt> m2</tt> is activated inside the method <tt> m1</tt>,
<P>
<PRE>    m2();
</PRE>
<P>
and
<P>
<PRE>    self-&gt;m2();
</PRE>
<P>
are the same.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000613500000000000000>5.13.5 Instantiation</A></H3>
<P>
Variables of a class type immediately after its declaration have no
references.  Instead they have zero as their values
(see Section <A HREF="node24.html#langlangmanualdatatypezero">5.4.2</A>).
By calling the constructors
defined in that class, the generated instances can be referred against
these variables (see Chapter <A HREF="node38.html#langlangmanualconstructor">5.18</A>).
<P>
Moreover, all instance assignments are
performed by references.
<P>
<PRE>class C {
  constructor: create;
 
  void create() { ... } 
}

C c;
c=&gt;create(); // generates an instance by calling 
             // the constructor, and assigns the
             // reference of the generated instance to c.
</PRE>
<P>
Also, by assigning 0 to the variables,
it is possible to clear the reference of instances belonging
to the variables.
<P>
<PRE>A a

a=&gt;create();
...
a = 0; // removes the reference to an instance.
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000613600000000000000>5.13.6 Abstract Class</A></H3>
 <A NAME=langlangmanualclassabstract>&#160;</A>
<P>
An abstract class is one where methods it defines have
their implementations in its descendants.
By using this abstract class in OZ++ language,
representation of abstract data types become possible.
Abstract classes can not generate instances.
Thus, they can be used only through inheritances
(see Chapter <A HREF="node37.html#langlangmanualinheritance">5.17</A>).
<P>
Abstract methods are ones which are defined in abstract classes,
but whose implementations are not defined there.
That is why a class having abstract methods is called an abstract class.
Therefore, in any of the following cases, errors occur:
<P>
<UL><LI> When declaring classes having no abstract methods as abstract classes
<P>
<LI> When not declaring classes having abstract methods as abstract classes
</UL>
<P>
Definitions of abstract methods are specified as attributes of methods
(see Section <A HREF="node33.html#langlangmanualclassmember">5.13.2</A>) in the following
way.  The implementation of these methods can not be
described.
<P>
<PRE>abstract class A {  // abstract class
  public: m1, m2;

  int m1() : abstract;
  int m2() : abstract;
}

class B {           // error: contains an abstract method
  public: m1, m2;

  int m1() { ... }
  int m2() : abstract;        
}

class C : A {       // inheritance of abstract method
  public: m1, m2;

  int m1() { ... }        
  int m2() { ... }        
     // the abstract methods defined in the abstract
     //  class A are redefined and methods are implemented.
}
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000613700000000000000>5.13.7 Generic Class</A></H3>
<P>
Generic classes contain generic parameters which represent
all types of data in their definitions.
By specifying a particular type to the generic parameters,
a generic class can also be used as an ordinary class.
<P>
The generic parameters are defined as shown below.
These parameters are included in the class name.
<P>
<PRE>class Collection&lt;T&gt; {
  public: Add;

  T Add (T content) { ... }
