<P>
This section describes the execution of the method of ordinary class 
and static class, the operator of the record.
(see Sections <A HREF="node33.html#langlangmanualclassmember">5.13.2</A>,
<A HREF="node34.html#langlangmanualstaticclassmember">5.14.2</A>, and
<A HREF="node32.html#langlangmanualrecordmember">5.12.1</A>).
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000623100000000000000>5.23.1 Method of Class</A></H3>
<P>
The <tt> private</tt> method and other methods of the class are executed differently.
<P>
<UL><LI> private method
<P>
The executing code is statically determined in compiling 
because the <tt> private</tt> method is used only in the defined class.  
Consequently, the method activating in the source codes is changed 
the form of the simple function call.
<P>
 <LI> Other methods
<P>
The other non-<tt> private</tt> methods load the correspondent execution code 
dynamically, and execute the code loaded.  
Accordingly, the method invocation in the source code should be converted 
to the calling of the correspondent method in execution code loaded.
<P>
Furthermore, because of the dynamic binding, the method to be executed is
not determined by the type of variable, 
but by the type of instance referred by the variable.
Moreover, if the global method is invoked, the special process should 
be performed as like the copy of the local object of the parameter.
<P>
In this way, the specific process is executed by using the run time routine 
of the executor instead of the simple function call.
<P>
</UL><H3><A NAME=SECTION000623200000000000000>5.23.2 Method of Static Class, Operator</A></H3>
<P>
Both the method of static class and the operator of the record are executed 
as simple function calls without the access control.
<P>
On the other hand, however, the function name after public compiling methods 
should be unique in the whole system of OZ++ because they are utilized 
in other classes.  
This is guaranteed by involving the ID of static class or the record 
into the function name in compilering.
