ncl - nucleus
<DT>SYNOPSIS
<DD> <P>
ncl
<DT>DESCRIPTION
<DD> <P>
Nucleus carries out the management (activation, generation) 
of executor in general.  It has the following functions:
<blockquote> <UL><LI> Provides information for the solution of network address
Finds a solution for the network address of another unknown 
executor when a demand arrives from the executor.
<LI> Carries out management of executor inside station
Grasps the executor state when the executor is activated.
<LI> Broadcasts
Nucleus enables broadcasts inside the site.
There are two types of broadcasts performed by the nucleus:
<UL><LI> solution for network address
<LI> search for class, name
</UL></UL></blockquote>
<P>
The shell variable OZROOT is root directory of OZ.
<DT>FILES
<DD> <P>
<UL><LI> $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table<BR> 
When activated, nucleus obtains its nucleus table from a 
file.
At present, it is used by the half router nuclei to enable 
them to recognize each other.
Nucleus acts as the physical transceiver of broadcasts with
other nuclei.
If the nucleus can not transceive broadcasts because other 
nuclei are beyond the range of physical transcription, the 
half rooter inside the site acts as the 'middle-man' of 
transcriptions.
<LI> $OZROOT/etc/site-id<BR> 
Nucleus obtains its site-id from a file.
<LI> $OZROOT/bin/executor<BR> 
The command path of executor.
<LI> $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/EXID/<b>&lt;</b>Hostname<b>&gt;</b><BR> 
This is the Executor-ID Management Information File.  The nucleus
stores the Executor-ID of the executor managed by the nucleus in
this file.  The Executor-ID is necessary for the generation of a
executor image.  The Executor-ID Management Nucleus also has an
Executor-ID of the site.
<LI> $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/ExID_manage.log<BR> 
This is the Log information of allocations for the Executor-ID
which only the Executor-ID Management Nucleus can update.
<LI> $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/log/<b>&lt;</b>Hostname<b>&gt;</b><BR> 
Log file of Nucleus.
</UL>
<DT>SHARED MEMORY
<DD> <P>
Nucleus, when activated, allocates shared memory with keys
1 and 2 to the entities of executor table and Hash table 
respectively.
This is used to manage the network addresses of executors 
that are either activated by the nucleus, or whose search 
for the network address solution is successful.

nfe - Nucleus Front-End
<DT>SYNOPSIS
<DD> <P>
nfe [Hostname]
<DT>DESCRIPTION
<DD> <P>
nfe is a tool which connects itself to a nucleus and manages
its generation state.
If a hostname is specified to ncl as an arguments, it connects
itself to the nucleus with that hostname, and exchanges
information with it by means of built-in commands.  If no
arguments are specified, nfe connects itself to its own host
nucleus.
<P>
<DT>FILES
<DD> <P>
<UL><LI> $HOME/.nclrc<BR> 
When nfe is activated, it executes the nfe command script
$HOME/.nclrc.  The built-in commands of nfe can be written 
in this script.
<PRE>    example:
        % cat $HOME/.nclrc
        alias c cex
        alias h help

<H3><A NAME=SECTION00034300000000000000>2.4.3 Activation of the Nucleus</A></H3>
<P>
The nucleus is activated as a UNIX command from a terminal.  At the
time of activation, the nucleus also activates the following file
transfer daemons:
<blockquote> <UL><LI> OzFileRecevier ....  File Receiving Daemon
<LI> OzFileSender   ....  File Transmitting Daemon
</UL></blockquote>
If any failure occurs in activating these daemons, the nucleus can not
be activated.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00034400000000000000>2.4.4 How to Terminate the Nucleus</A></H3>
<P>
The nucleus termination process is performed by nclshutdown, which
is a built-in command in the nucleus front end (nfe).  The termination
process is performed as follows:
<P>
<blockquote> <DL ><DT>(1)
<DD> Disconnection of a Half Rooter Nucleus.<BR> 
If the nucleus is a half router nucleus, disconnect other half
routers.
<DT>(2)
<DD> Forcible Termination of the Executor<BR> 
Forcible termination takes place when the terminating nucleus
sends the break signal SIGTERM to all executors activated from
this nucleus.  After terminating the executors, the nucleus
removes the following two files under the directory /tmp:
<UL><LI> Dm
<LI> Oz
</UL>
<DT>(3)
<DD> Deletion of the Executor Table<BR> 
The executor table is made up of shared memories which are shared
by the executors. The nucleus deletes all the shared memories.
<DT>(4)
<DD> Notification of Completion of Termination Process to the 
Nucleus Front-End (nfe)
<DT>(5)
<DD> All connecting nucleus front ends (nfe) are notified of completion
of the termination process.
<P>
 </DL></blockquote><H3><A NAME=SECTION00034500000000000000>2.4.5 Forcible Termination of the Nucleus</A></H3>
<P>
The nucleus, being activated as a daemon, can be terminated (forcibly)
by using the UNIX command kill.  The nucleus is forcibly terminated by
sending either of the break signals SIGHUP(1) or SIGTERM(15).
<P>
If the nucleus is terminated abnormally, the shared memory might remain
intact.  If the nucleus is not to be re-activated, it is advisable to
delete this memory with the UNIX command ipcrm.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00034600000000000000>2.4.6 Set up of Nucleus Table</A></H3>
<P>
The nucleus table ($OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table) is a text file which
states the role of the specified nucleus.  When you start up the nucleus,
it reads the file.
<P>
In the nucleus table, you register the name or IP address of the host on
which the special nucleus runs by using an editor.
<P>
Configuration of halfrouter nucleus <BR>
<P>
The halfrouter nucleus relays a physical broadcast at a site and enables
a logical broadcast to enter it.  If the site consists of multiple
segments (a transceivable range of a physical broadcast), each segment
must contain a halfrouter nucleus.
<P>
<PRE>    Example:
       A site 1 consists of two segments.
           Segment A:
               hostname1, hostname2
           Segment B:
               hostname3, hostname4

       If both range A and range B are to be considered as being inside
       the same site, the nucleus table ($ZOROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table)
       should be written as follows.
       Let hostname1 and hostname3 be a halfrouter nucleus.

           % cat NCL_table
           HALFROUTER:hostname1:
           HALFROUTER:hostname3:

       In this case, when hostname2 transmits the broadcast message, it
       is sent to all segments of the site as follows:

       (1) Hostname1 receives the broadcast message.  Since this host can
           recognize itself as a halfrouter, it introduces broadcast
           demands to other halfrouters (hostname3). 
       (2) When hostname3 receives the broadcast demand from hostname1,
           it sends a physical broadcast. 
       (3) Hostname4 receives this broadcast.
</PRE>
<P>
Configuration of Executor-ID Management Nucleus <BR>
<P>
The Executor-ID Management Nucleus manages all the Executor-IDs which are
given at the site.  It allocates the specified numbers of Executor-IDs
when on other nucleus requests it.
<P>
It is guaranteed that no Executor-ID overlaps another at a site, because
central management of the Executor-ID is done by the Executor-ID Management
Nucleus.
<P>
<PRE>    Example: 
        The Executor-ID Management Nucleus is assumed to be specified in
        the nucleus table when the OZ++ system is installed.  However, we
        describe how to specify the Executor-ID Management Nucleus by
        assuming the case where the nucleus table is changed. 
        If you want to put hostnameN as an Executor-ID Management Nucleus,
        you have to type in the nucleus table ($OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table)
        as follows.  You must not write multiple Executor-ID Management
        Nucleus in it.)

            % cat NCL_table
            EXIDMANAGE:hostnameN:
</PRE>
<P>
As the Executor-ID Management Nucleus does not allow the timing of a
request from the nucleus to be specified at a site, you are advised to
set this up in a station which is always operating.
<P>
Configuration of a Relay Nucleus <BR>
<P>
The relay nucleus communicates with the application gateway, and relays the
transmission of demands to and reception of demands from other sites.
<P>
The setup of a relay nucleus defines the application gateway corresponding
to the relay nucleus in the nucleus table.
<P>
<PRE>    RELAYNCL:&lt;IP-Address of Relay Nucleus&gt;:&lt;OZAG IP-Address&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
For those nuclei registered as relay nuclei, it is necessary to maintain
mutual consistency between these nuclei and the relay nuclei registered in
the local site information of the application gateway.
<P>
For example, when the relay nucleus is set to bun13, and the application
gateway is set to bunax3:
<P>
<PRE>     % cat $OZROOT/etc/apgw_LSiteInfo
     0005:bun13:3777:CLOSE_SITE
     % cat $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table
     RELAYNCL:bun13:bunax3
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00034700000000000000>2.4.7 Description of the Executor-ID Management Information File</A></H3>
<P>
The Executor-ID Management Information File is a text file.  It stores
Executor-ID kept by nucleus.  Since this file is generated and updated
automatically, you only need to recover it when some trouble occurs.
Just after the OZ++ system is installed, no nucleus has an Executor-ID.
When you generate some executor image, a nucleus requests the Executor-ID
from the Executor-ID Management Nucleus and obtains the specified numbers
 of Executor-ID.  It is assumed that the contents of the Executor-ID
Management Information File are as follows:
<PRE>      #
      # Informations of ExecutorID Management
      #
      IN_ACTIVITY:ExecutorID(1000),Rest(100)
      RESERVATION:ExecutorID(0000),Rest(0)
</PRE>
In these contents, you can use the Executor-ID from 1000 (hex) and the
amount 100(hex) of Executor-ID is kept.  If the amount of Rest is less
than a(hex), the Executor-ID Management Nucleus is requested to keep
Executor-ID as a reservation, and the result is written in the RESERVATION
line.
<P>
For the Executor-ID Management Nucleus, management information items
include not only the above, but also the following statement, because it
manages the Executor-ID of a site.
<PRE>      EXID_OF_SITE:0001100
</PRE>
This means that the Executor-ID is available from 1100 in the current
site.  The value 0 is appropriate in the line of IN_ACTIVITY and
RESERVATION if the Executor-ID Management Information File of the
Executor-ID Management Nucleus has been lost because of some trouble.
However, the EXID_OF_SITE line of Executor-ID Management Information must
be recovered using log information ($OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/ExID_manage.log).
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00034800000000000000>2.4.8 Trouble-shooting with the Nucleus</A></H3>
<P>
Sometimes the nucleus can not be activated.  Reasons are thought to be 
as follows:
<P>
<DL ><DT>(1)
<DD> Files essential for activating the nucleus can not be opened.<BR> 
The files required while activating the nucleus are:
<UL><LI> $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table
<LI> $OZROOT/etc/site-id
</UL>
This is considered to be because:
<UL><LI> The setup of the environment variable OZROOT is incorrect.
<LI> The setup of file permissions under the directory $OZROOT is 
incorrect
<LI> There are some errors in the description of the nucleus table 
($OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table).
</UL>
<DT>(2)
<DD> The port used by the nucleus can not be bound.<BR> 
The following message is displayed:
<PRE>    init_ncl_port: bind: Address already in use
    init_ncl_port: Other Nucleus start up already ?
</PRE>
This is considered to be because:
<UL><LI> The station already contains an activated nucleus, and another one 
is about to be activated.
<LI> The port is already bound by an application other than the nucleus.
</UL>
<DT>(3)
<DD> The shared memory can be neither created nor attached.<BR> 
The nucleus allocates two types of shared memories to be used as 
executor tables.  These shared memories can be created by  keys 1 and 2.
If other applications are using the same key shared memory, the nucleus
can not be activated without user permission.  If the shared memory is 
to be re-utilized, user permission should be altered.  However, this 
might adversely affect other applications.
<DT>(4)
<DD> The file transfer daemons (OZFileReceiver and OZFileSender) can not
be created.<BR> 
The previously activated nucleus might have been terminated forcibly.
If the nucleus is terminated abnormally, the file transfer daemons
remain activated. In such cases, the UNIX command 'ps' can be used to
check the process id's of file transfer daemons, and using the UNIX
command 'kill' can be used to kill these processes.
<DT>(5)
<DD> The Executor-ID Management File can not be opened.<BR> 
The following message is displayed.
<PRE>    init_exid_mnginfo: Can't open ExecutorID management file(.....)
</PRE>
This is considered to be because:
<UL><LI> In the case of the Executor-ID Management Nucleus, the Executor-ID
Management Information File has been removed by some reason, such
as, trouble in the file system or human error.
<LI> In the case of an ordinary nucleus, the user-ID of the OS process
of the nucleus or the permission mode of the Executor-ID Management
Information File has been changed.
</UL>
How to recover:<BR> 
Recover the Executor Management Information using log information
($OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/ExID_manage.log).  Refer to section 7 for further
information.

<DT>SYNOPSIS
<DD> <P>
newimage [newimage options]
<DT>DESCRIPTION
<DD> <P>
This command gets an optional Executor-ID from the nucleus and
allocates it as an argument of the command &quot;newimage,&quot; then start up.
When newimage finishes normally, this command registers an Executor-ID
acquired as the maintenance information of itself.
<DT>OPTIONS
<DD> <P>
`Newimage' recognizes the following options:
<PRE>     -n This option puts a matched name to the obtained Executor-ID.
        You can nominate it by using an argument for the built-in command
        &quot;cex&quot; when you start to run an Executor.
     -c This option puts a remark to the obtained Executor.
     -g Set the kind of class to `without monitor'.
     -d domain-name
        Set the name of the domain to which this executor belongs to
        `domain-name'.
     -u user-name
        Set the name of the owner of this executor.
     -k configuration-name
        Use one of the standard configurations.  `Configuration-name' is
        one of the following:

            site-master, or 1
            station-master, or 2
            slave-with-class, or 3
            slave-without-class, or 4

     -o image-directory-path
        Target directory of executor image.

<DT>SYNOPSIS
<DD> <P>
nclshutdown time
<DT>DESCRIPTION
<DD> <P>
nclshutdown tells the nfe the time the nucleus should be 
automatically shut down.
The shutdown time is specified as the argument time. If
&quot;now&quot; is specified, the nucleus is shutdown immediately. 
Otherwise, the shutdown time is specified in the form of
a +number which indicates the time in minutes.
<P>
As the time to shutdown of the nucleus approaches, warning
messages are displayed periodically in the nfe.
<P>
If CONTROL-D is pressed within the time period specified
by the +number, shutdown is aborted, and the nfe is terminated.
<P>
If the nucleus is shut down, the nfe is terminated
automatically.
