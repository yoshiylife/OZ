<P>
C statements enabling the source code of C language to be described 
in the source code of OZ++ as the interface to other languages are provided.  
The following description explains the method of use, its grammar, 
and restrictions of usage.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000622100000000000000>5.22.1 How to Use Interface</A></H3>
<P>
The form of use of C statement described with the source code of OZ++ 
is as follows:
<P>
<UL><LI>  Describe the implementation of the method of OZ++
<LI>  Execute the type definition, the function definition, and 
the included files which are effective only within the scope 
of a certain class (one file).
</UL><H3><A NAME=SECTION000622200000000000000>5.22.2 Syntax</A></H3>
<P>
<PRE>c_stmt
        : 'inline' '&quot;C&quot;'  '{' inline_body '}'
        ;

inline_body
        : /* empty */
        | inline_body STRINGS
        ;
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME=SECTION000622300000000000000>5.22.3 Restriction of Usage</A></H3>
<P>
variable <BR>
<P>
C statement enables access to the variables defined in OZ++ language accessible 
from a block including C statements.  
In short, it can access to the instance variables defined in the class
which has the method 
described with C statement 
and automatic variables in the block including its C statement.
<P>
The basic type and array type variables can be accessed as variables of 
the same type and name.
<P>
The class type variables can be accessed only to the local object 
by retaining the same name and by changing the type as follows:
<P>
<PRE>(OZ++) &lt;class name in school&gt; 
   -&gt; (C statement) OZ_ObjectPart_&lt;class name in school&gt; 
        or OZ_ObjectAll_&lt;class name in school&gt;

Example;

(OZ++) List
   -&gt; (C statement) OZ_ObjectPart_List or OZ_ObjectAll_List
</PRE>
<P>
The static class variable can be accessed by retaining the same name and 
by changing the type as follows:
<P>
<PRE>(OZ++) &lt;class name in school&gt; 
   -&gt; (C statement) OZ_StaticObject_&lt;class name in school&gt; 

Example;

(OZ++) List
   -&gt; (C statement) OZ_StaticObject_List
</PRE>
<P>
The record type variable can be accessed by retaining the same name and 
by changing the type as follows:
<P>
<PRE>(OZ++) &lt;record name in school&gt; 
   -&gt; (C statement) OZ_Record_&lt;record name in a school&gt; 
   
Example;

(OZ++) List
   -&gt; (C statement) OZ_Record_List
</PRE>
<P>
It is possible to access to the instance variable of the object and 
the member of the record as a member of the structure. 
'<tt> oz</tt>' should be put on the head of the name of the instance variable 
or the name of member of the record when they are accessed.
<P>
<PRE>Example;

class Figure {
  int X, Y;
}

class Rect : Figure {
  int Width, Height;
} 
 
Rect r;

r=&gt;new();

inline &quot;C&quot; 
  {
    int width = ((OZ_ObjectPart_Rectr)-&gt;ozWidth;
    int x ((OZ_ObjectPart_Figure)
        ((OZ_ObjectAll_Rect) OzExecGetObjectTop (r))
          -&gt;part[0])-&gt;ozX;
  }
</PRE>
<P>
Method and Operator <BR>
<P>
Only the class describing C statement, the method defined by statistic class 
and the operator defined by the record can be used as function calls.  
The function names should be changed as follows:
<P>
<PRE>(OZ++) &lt;method name&gt; of the class 
  -&gt; (C statement) _oz_&lt;method name&gt;

or

(OZ++) &lt;method name&gt; of &lt;ID of the statistic class in school&gt;
  -&gt; (C statement) _oz_&lt;ID of the statistic class in school&gt;
      _&lt;method name&gt;

or

(OZ++) &lt;operator name&gt; of &lt;ID of the record in school&gt;
  -&gt; (C statement) _oz_&lt;'ID' of the record in school&gt;
      _&lt;operator name&gt;

Example;

(OZ++) method of class Insert ()
  -&gt; (C statement) _oz_Insert ()

(OZ++) method Insert () of static class (ID = 
   0001000002000123)
  -&gt; (C statement) _oz_001000002000123_Insert ()
</PRE>
<P>
Access Control <BR>
<P>
As clearly described above, C statement is not restricted by the access control 
of OZ++, and by using C statement, the instance variable and the access 
of method is enabled with no relation to the access control of the class 
and statistic class of OZ++.
