 <H2><A NAME=SECTION00068000000000000000>5.8 Process</A></H2>
 <A NAME=langlangmanualprocess>&#160;</A>
<P>

Here we explain the process derived type, which is one of the elements
for the implementation of OZ++'s concurrent programming (see Chapter
<A HREF="node39.html#langlangmanualconcurrent">5.19</A>).
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00068100000000000000>5.8.1 Concept of a process in OZ++</A></H3>
<P>
In OZ++ language, the execution of methods is
performed 
as follows:
<P>

<OL><LI>  The object which activates the method generates a message.
<P>
<LI>  The message is sent to the receiving object.
<P>
<LI>  The object receiving the message executes the computation.
<P>
<LI>  The computation result is sent back to the object which
	activated the method.
</OL>
<P>
The object which received the message can also send it to other
objects.  This means that nesting of method call is possible.
<P>
Therefore, in general the execution of methods becomes a chain of
method activations, and in OZ++ this chain called a <b> process</b>.
<P>
OZ++ has the following kinds of processes:
<P>
<UL><LI>  There are no parent-child relationships.
<P>
<LI>  A process can be awaited until the termination of the process
which is different from the one generating it.
<P>
</UL><H3><A NAME=SECTION00068200000000000000>5.8.2 A Process Derived Type</A></H3>
<P>

As explained above, whenever a method is activated in OZ++ a process
can be generated.  Process derived types are provided to store the
generated process.  It is possible to make derived types from any
types.  If the original type is <tt> foo</tt>, the process is of the type
which returns the <tt> foo</tt> type.
<P>
The process derived type is defined
inside 
the variable declaration as
follows (see Section 1<A HREF="node31.html#langlangmanualdeclarationvar">5.11.6</A>):
<P>
<PRE>class A;

int  @p1;       // a process that returns an int
A    @p2;       // a process that returns class A
char @p3[];     // a process that returns the array containing
                // a char type element 
void @p4        // a process that returns any types
</PRE>
<P>
As <tt> p4</tt> in the example above, declaration of variables can be assigned any type by using <tt> void</tt>.
<P>
If the process type has 0 as its rvalue, it means that
neither process is being referred.  Therefore, immediately after the
process is declared, it has the value 0.  Also, by assigning 0 to the
process, it can be brought to a state where no processes are referred
(see Section <A HREF="node24.html#langlangmanualdatatypezero">5.4.2</A>).
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00068300000000000000>5.8.3 Operations of Processes</A></H3>
 <A NAME=langlangmanualprocessoperation>&#160;</A>
<P>
The following kinds of operations can be performed as a process:
<P>
<UL><LI> Generation (<tt> fork</tt>)
<P>
<LI> Unite (<tt> join</tt>)
<P>
<LI> Separation (<tt> detach</tt>)
<P>
<LI> Termination (<tt> kill</tt>)
<P>
<LI> Abortion (<tt> abort</tt>)
</UL>
<P>
<tt> fork</tt> <BR>
<P>
A process is spawned (i.e. forked) when this generation is explicitly
specified during the activation of a method.
<P>
This is described as an expression as follows (see Section <A HREF="node29.html#langlangmanualexpunary">5.9.4</A>):
<P>
<PRE>exp
        | 'fork' exp INVOKE IDENTIFIER '(' arg_list ')'
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>class A {
  public: m1;

  int m1() { ... }
}

A a1;
int @p1;                // process

a1=&gt;new();
p1 = fork a1-&gt;m1();     // generation of process
</PRE>
<P>
Both the generated process and the generating process are executed concurrently.
<P>
<tt> join</tt> <BR>
<P>
The operation where the termination of the forked process is awaited until the result of the method executed by this process is obtained, is called <tt> join</tt>.
<P>
This is described as an expression as follows (see Section <A HREF="node29.html#langlangmanualexpunary">5.9.4</A>):
<P>
<PRE>exp
        | 'join' exp
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>class A {
  public: m1;

  int m1() { ... }
}

A a;
int @p, result;

a=&gt;new();
p = fork a-&gt;m1();    // generation of process
...
result = join p;     // after joining obtain the return
                     // value of int type which p returns
</PRE>
<P>
If an already terminated process is joined, it returns its return value and goes back to the control.  In the example above, if the method activation of <tt> a-&gt;m1()</tt> terminates, the return value of <tt> p</tt> is reserved until the control reaches <tt> result = join p</tt>.
<P>
Furthermore, the termination of a process' execution (i.e. joining) can only be awaited once.  If a process is joined more than twice, an error occurs.
<P>
<PRE>A a;
int @p, r1, r2;

a=&gt;new();
p = fork a-&gt;m1();
...
r1 = join p;
...
r2 = join p;      // error: joining the same process twice
</PRE>
<P>
<tt> detach</tt> <BR>
<P>
If the operation `detach' is executed against a forked process, there is
no need to wait until the execution of this process terminates.  <tt>
detach</tt> is described as follows (see Section
<A HREF="node30.html#langlangmanualstatementconcurrent">5.10.9</A>):
<P>
<PRE>concurrent_stmt:
        |  'detach' exp ';'
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>class A;

A a;
int @p;

a=&gt;new();
p = fork a-&gt;m1();
...
detach p;        // separation of process
...
detach p;        // NOP: the process is separated twice
</PRE>
<P>
As in the above example, an already separated process is separated again by detach.  However, in OZ++ language, separating the same process more than twice has no effect and is considered harmless.
<P>
<tt> join</tt> and <tt> detach</tt> <BR>
<P>
Only one of the operations join and detach can be used in a forked process.  This means if joined processes are detached, or if detached process processes are joined, an error occurs.
<P>
<PRE>class A

A a;
int @p1, @p2, result;

a=&gt;new();
p1 = fork a-&gt;m1();
p2 = fork a-&gt;m1();
...

if (result = join p1)
  {
    detach p2;
    ...
    result = join p2;   // error: detached processes
  }                     //  can not be joined
else
  {
    detach p1;          // error: joined processes 
    ...                 //  can not be detached
  }
</PRE>
<P>
<tt> kill</tt> <BR>
<P>
The operation which involves forcible termination of generated processes without waiting for its normal termination is called termination (or kill) (see Section <A HREF="node30.html#langlangmanualstatementconcurrent">5.10.9</A>).
<P>
<PRE>concurrent_stmt:
        |  'kill' exp ';'
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>class A;

A a;
int @p;

a=&gt;new();
p = fork a-&gt;m1();
...
kill p;        // termination of process
</PRE>
<P>

The process killed may not terminate immediately.  If the process
satisfies the following conditions, the time when the process
terminates is later than the time when kill operation is performed.
<P>
<UL><LI> If the process is executing a <tt> wait</tt> statement, and if the
monitor-lock of the object which the process is executing is open, the
kill operation becomes effective after the wait process terminates.
(see Section <A HREF="node39.html#langlangmanualconcurrentcondition">5.19.1</A>)
<P>
<LI> If the process is about to execute a <tt> wait</tt> statement.
<P>
<LI> If the process executes an <tt> abortable</tt> statement
      (which is explained later).
</UL>
<P>
The actual kill operation involves the generation of system exception
<tt> Abort</tt>.  (see Section
<A HREF="node39.html#langlangmanualconcurrentcondition">5.19.1</A>)
<P>
Programmers can use the <tt> abortable</tt> statement to describe the
timing of kill operation.  If the kill operation is not executed for a
currently running process including its methods, it has no effect.
<P>
<tt> abort</tt> <BR>
<P>
The process for forcibly terminating a currently running process
including its methods is called <tt> abort</tt>.
<P>
It is described as follows (see Section
<A HREF="node30.html#langlangmanualstatementconcurrent">5.10.9</A>):
<P>
<PRE>concurrent_stmt:
        |  'abort' ';'
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>method ()
  {     
    ...    
    abort;        // abort the current process not reached
    ...          
  }
</PRE>
<P>
If <tt> abort</tt> is executed, system exception Abort is generated (see
Section <A HREF="node39.html#langlangmanualconcurrentcondition">5.19.1</A>).
