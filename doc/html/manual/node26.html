<P>
In OZ++ language, there are two kinds of type conversions:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> Those performed on some operators, 
according to their operands (i.e. standard conversions)
<P>
<LI> Those performed explicitly on class instances (i.e. narrowings) 
</UL><H3><A NAME=SECTION00066100000000000000>5.6.1 Standard  Conversions</A></H3>
<P>
Integral Promotion <BR>
<P>
<tt> Char</tt> and <tt> short</tt> , whether or not unsigned, can be used
wherever integers are used.  If all the values of the original types
can be expressed as <tt> int</tt>, they are converted to type <tt> int</tt>.
If not, they are converted into the <tt> unsigned int</tt> type.  This
process is called integral promotion.
<P>
Conversion of Integers <BR>
<P>

Integers (i.e. <tt> char</tt>, <tt> short</tt>, <tt> int</tt>, <tt> long</tt>, and
<tt> long long</tt>) are converted into unsigned integers.  If the
unsigned integers are small numbers, the conversion is equivalent to
truncating the most significant bits (of the internal representation
of the numbers).  Otherwise, either extra zeros are added to the right
hand side or extensions of sign are performed.
<P>
Integers and Floating Point Numbers <BR>
<P>
<UL><LI> When a floating point number is converted into an integer:
<P>
The numbers after the decimal point are truncated; 
If the floating
point number is beyond the range of integers, the number is not
defined; Similarly, if the floating point number is negative, the
unsigned integer equivalent to it is also not defined.
<P>
<LI> When an integer is converted into a floating point number:
<P>
 It is converted into a floating point number which is nearest to the
original integer.  If it can not be expressed as a floating
point number, the result of conversion is not defined.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<tt> float</tt> and <tt> double</tt> <BR>
<P>
<UL><LI> When a low precision floating point number is converted into
a high precision floating point number:
<P>
The value does not change.
<P>
<LI>   When a high precision floating point number is converted into
a low precision floating point number:
<P>

The integer is converted into a floating point number which is nearest
to the original integer.  However, if the number can not be expressed
as a floating point number, the result of conversion is not defined
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Arithmetic Conversions <BR>
<P>
Operators can cause the following kinds of type conversions:
<P>
<BR> 
If either of the operands is of the <tt> double</tt> type,<BR> 
the other is also converted into <tt> double</tt>.<BR> 
Otherwise,<BR> 
if either of the operands is of the <tt> float</tt> type,<BR> 
the other is also converted into <tt> float</tt>.<BR> 
Otherwise, integral promotion is performed on both operands.
<BR> 
If either of the operands is of the <tt> unsigned long</tt> type,<BR> 
the other is also converted into <tt> unsigned long</tt>.<BR> 
Otherwise,<BR> 
if either of the operands is of the <tt> long</tt> type,<BR> 
if the other is <tt> unsigned long</tt>,<BR> 
and if the <tt> unsigned int</tt> type can be expressed as <tt> long</tt>,<BR> 
it is converted into <tt> long</tt>.<BR> 
Otherwise the <tt> unsigned int</tt> type can not be expressed<BR> 
as long, both operand is converted into <tt> unsigned long</tt>.<BR> 
Otherwise, the other operand is also converted into <tt> long</tt>.<BR> 
Otherwise,<BR> 
if either of the operands is of the <tt> unsigned int</tt> type,<BR> 
the other is also converted into <tt> unsigned int</tt>.<BR> 
Otherwise, both operands are <tt> int</tt>. <BR>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00066200000000000000>5.6.2 Consistency of Types</A></H3>
 
<A NAME=langlangmanualtypeexchangeconsistency>&#160;</A>
<P>
When considering the assignment operation
<P>
<PRE>        x = e
</PRE>
<tt> x</tt> is the left hand side value, 
 i.e. it may be either an instance
variable of a class or a local variable of a method.  The <tt> x</tt> may
be 
any of the following types:
<P>
<UL><LI> Basic data type (see Chapter <A HREF="node24.html#langlangmanualdatatype">5.4</A>)
<LI> Process derived type (see Chapter <A HREF="node28.html#langlangmanualprocess">5.8</A>)
<LI> Array derived type (see Chapter <A HREF="node27.html#langlangmanualarray">5.7</A>)
<LI> User-defined type (see Chapter <A HREF="node25.html#langlangmanualusertype">5.5</A>)
</UL>
Otherwise, the type of x is fixed by generic parameters (see Chapter
<A HREF="node25.html#langlangmanualusertype">5.5</A>).
<P>
In OZ++ language, the rules which decide whether or not the above
assignment is valid are as follows.
<P>
The Commutative Rules of Types <BR>
<P>
When the type of <tt> x</tt> is <tt> X</tt>, and the type of <tt> y</tt> is <tt>
Y</tt>, the assignment of <tt> x</tt> into <tt> y</tt> is described as follows.
<P>
<PRE>        X x;
        Y y;
        x = y;
</PRE>
<P>
This assignment is valid only if any of the following cases are true.
<P>
<OL><LI>  <tt> X</tt> and <tt> Y</tt> are of the same type.
<P>
<LI>  Both <tt> X</tt> and <tt> Y</tt> are basic type
 (in this case the laws of type conversions must also be satisfied).
<P>
<LI>  <tt> X</tt> is a process derived type of 
<tt> void</tt> and <tt> Y</tt> is (any type of) a process derived type.
<P>
<LI>  <tt> Y</tt> can be adapted to <tt> X</tt> (see next section).
<P>
<LI>  <tt> X</tt> is an array derived type of 
type <tt> Z</tt> and <tt> Y</tt> is an array derived
type adapted to  <tt> Z</tt> (see next section).
</OL>
<P>
The Adaptation Rules of Types <BR> 
 
<P>
Only in the following conditions, type <tt> Y</tt> is adapted to type <tt> X</tt>:
<P>
<OL><LI>  Both <tt> X</tt> and <tt> Y</tt> are identical.
<P>
<LI>  Both <tt> X</tt> and <tt> Y</tt> are class types.  
<tt> X</tt> has no generic parameters, and <tt> Y</tt> directly inherits <tt>
X</tt> (see Chapter <A HREF="node37.html#langlangmanualinheritance">5.17</A> ).
<P>
<LI>  There is a type <tt> Z</tt> to which <tt> Y</tt> is adapted, 
and <tt> Z</tt> is adapted to <tt> X</tt>.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
<PRE>class A {
  ...
}

class B : A {
  ...
}

class C : B {
  ...
}
</PRE>
<P>
In the above examples, by the second rule of adaptation, <tt> C</tt> is
adapted to <tt> B</tt>, and similarly <tt> B</tt> is adapted to <tt> A</tt>.
Hence, according to the third rule of adaptation, <tt> C</tt> is adapted to
<tt> A</tt>.  Therefore, the following assignments are valid.
<P>
<PRE>        A a;
        C c;

        a = c;
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00066300000000000000>5.6.3 Narrowing</A></H3>
<P>
Consider the consistency of the above sample codes.  After <tt> a</tt> is
assigned to <tt> c</tt>, <tt> a</tt> refers to the instance of class <tt> C</tt>.
Therefore, in this case, type of <tt> a</tt> is convertible 
from <tt> A</tt>
to <tt> C</tt>.
<P>
Thus, when instances of a class (e.g. <tt> C</tt>) are accessed as classes
above it 
 (e.g. <tt> A</tt>), the type currently being accessed can be
converted so that this class accesses other classes
below the class 
representing the type.  This kind of type conversions is called <b>
narrowing</b>.
<P>
OZ++ is a language in which the type check is performed
statically.  Narrowing is an exceptional case, where type checks are
performed dynamically.  If narrowing fails, a system exception <tt>
NarrowFailed</tt> (see Section <A HREF="node36.html#langlangmanualexceptkind">5.16.1</A>) is
generated.
<P>
<PRE>A a1, a2;
B b1, b2, b3;
C c1, c2, c3;

c1=&gt;new();          // generates the instance of C
b1=&gt;new();          // generates the instance of B
        
a1 = c;             // assigns the reference of the instance
                    // of C to a1, and accesses this as A
a2 = b1;            // assigns the reference of the instance
                    // of B to a2, and accesses this as A

c2 = narrow(C, a1); // the instance of C is accessed as C
b2 = narrow(B, a1); // the instance of C is accessed as B
b3 = narrow(B, a2); // the instance of B is accessed as B

c3 = narrow(C, a2); // error: because a2 is referring to 
                    // the instance of B
</PRE>
<P>
In the above example, instances of classes <tt> C</tt> and <tt> B</tt> are
generated.  These instances, which are accessed as <tt> A</tt>, are
narrowed to be accessed as <tt> C</tt> and <tt> B</tt>.  In the last
statement, as the instance of <tt> B</tt> is tried to be accessed as its
child class <tt> C</tt>, the narrowing fails.
<P>
Narrowing does not use the types of variables in the program, but
types of instances referred to when
the execution of variables 
take
place.  This may cause actions which might have been unpredictable
during the coding of the program.  This, eventually, might be
dangerous.  However, sometimes this effect can also be used to
abstract particular classes from the instances, as shown in the
following example:
<P>
<PRE>class A {
  ...
}

class B : A {
  ...
}

class C {
  public: m1;

  void m1(A a)
   {
     B b;

     try 
       {
         b = narrow(B, a);
       }
     except
       {
         // a is not an instance of B.
       }
    }
}
</PRE>
