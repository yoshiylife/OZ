<H3><A NAME=SECTION00043200000000000000>3.3.2 Programming in OZ++</A></H3>
<P>
Here we explain the necessary concepts to perform programming in OZ++.
<P>
Class <BR>
<P>
  In OZ++, a class is given a distinguishable ID (version ID) unique to 
the entire system. Each class is managed by means of this ID.  In other 
words, each class is managed by its version.  This version classifies 
the function of a class into the following three parts.  Each part is 
given a different version ID.
<P>
<OL><LI> There is an interface part (i.e. public part) for passing 
messages.  This part corresponds to the signature of a public member.
This part must be recompiled to make any alterations made on this part 
effective for classes using public members.
<P>
<LI> There is an interface part (i.e. protected part) to be used 
through inheritance.  This part corresponds to the signatures and the 
type of instance variables of protected methods.  Recompilation is 
necessary to make any alterations effective for subclasses of this class.
<P>
<LI> There is an implementation part for the interfaces of 1 and 2.
The definition of instance variables also corresponds to this part.
Any alterations made to this part can be made effective without 
recompilation (as mentioned later).
</OL>
  Among these three parts, there is a descending relation in the order: 
public part, protected part, and implementation part.  Each part has 
an upper part, and several lower parts.  Any of the lower parts can 
be specified to its default version.  The default versions are used 
if the user does not specify version.  Moreover, the public part has 
a root part as its upper part.  This root part is representative of 
all versions for a given class.
<P>
The Language Processor <BR>
<P>
  A class is distinguished by its ID in the entire system of the OZ++.
However, while programming, it is necessary to denote class names 
in source codes.  Therefore, the compiler must convert class names 
into ID's.  For this purpose, we introduce a conversion table called 
the school.  The school is a list of pairs of class names and ID's, 
and while programming it provides a local space for labels of a class.
<P>
   In object oriented programming, using only the interface exposed by 
classes leads to programming which is independent of the implementation 
of classes. By combining this characteristic with the framework of 
version management, it is possible to delay the implementation part's 
version of a class used in the program.  Thus, flexible operations 
like this becomes possible in OZ++.  In the language processor, an 
investigation into the use of the interface is carried out by accessing 
the interface information in the public or protected part. To obtain 
the information used in this investigation, the compiler not only 
generates execution codes but also outputs information concerning the 
interface of both public and protected parts.  Therefore, compilation 
of a class in OZ++ involves processing the class in three parts: public, 
protected, and implementation.  The output of each part is registered 
in the class management system.  The investigation of interfaces is 
carried out by obtaining this information.
<P>
The versions to be used are determined as follows:
<P>
<UL><LI> For the class using the public part, versions up to its public 
part are determined during compilation, and the version of its 
implementation part is determined during instance generation.
<P>
<LI> For the inheriting class, versions up to its protected part are 
determined during compilation, and the version of its implementation 
part is determined during instance generation.
</UL>
  The process that determines the implementation part's version during 
instance generation is called the configure.  The information resulting 
from this configure (i.e. configuration) is also class information, and 
is managed by the class management system.
<P>
Compilations <BR>
<P>
Compilations are performed after activating the compiler front end and 
by specifying a school on the Work Bench.  In OZ++, compilations are 
performed in three parts. Each part has the following constraints:
<P>
<OL><LI> Compilation of Each Part
<P>
<UL><LI> The upper part has to be compiled before the lower part.  
For example, to compile the protected part, the public part must first 
be compiled.
<LI> Depending on the school, compilation converts a class name into an
ID.  Therefore, the class being used must exist in the specified school.
</UL>
<P>
<LI> Compilation of Public Part
<UL><LI> The class of the protected part, which is inherited, must be
compiled.
</UL>
<P>
<LI> Compilation of Implementation Part
<UL><LI> The class of the public part, which is used, must compiled.
</UL></OL>
<P>
Upgrading Versions <BR>
<P>
The version of a class is upgraded by specifying it during the compilation
of the three parts.  If version upgrading is specified, the upgrading of 
parts lower than the one specified is demanded to the class management 
system.  For example, if version upgrading is specified during 
compilation of the public part, the class management system creates new 
versions for all three parts below the public part.  Furthermore, new 
version ID's are given to the three parts.
<P>
Generic class terminology <BR>
<P>
<UL><LI> Formal generic class
<P>
Generic class with undefined type parameter
<P>
<LI> Real generic class
<P>
Formal generic class with specified type parameter

<H3><A NAME=SECTION00043400000000000000>3.3.4 Upgrading Versions</A></H3>
<P>
In the processors of this version and those yet to be released, the version
 of classes can be upgraded.  However, precompiled classes can not 
be overwritten.  Therefore, if a part which has already been generated 
is recompiled, an error message is displayed.  In such cases, upgrading 
of the version is performed as follows:
<P>
<OL><LI> After selecting the checkbox 'New Version', compile the part to 
be generated.
<LI> However, when compiling an entirely new class, instead of New 
Version, simply select New.
</OL>
<P>
Furthermore, if the version is upgraded in the compilation of Public and 
Protected, new ID's must be given not only to the part to be compiled 
but also to the parts below.  For example, if this is performed, give 
new ID's for all three parts Public, Protected, and Implementation. 
This eventually causes the contents of the school to change.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00043500000000000000>3.3.5 Configure</A></H3>
<P>
It is necessary to execute Configure to use classes that have been 
compiled as far as implementation.
<P>
In Configure, it is necessary to specify which version of the 
implementation part of classes and all ancestors of classes. However, 
the implementation part included the school will be used if no version 
is specified.
<P>
To execute &quot;One...&quot;, it is possible to select the implementation part 
by clicking &quot;Other...&quot; of each class.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00043600000000000000>3.3.6 Regenerating real generic</A></H3>
<P>
Regenerating specified real generic is possible by using Again in One... 
of Generic. In this case, a new version will be generated. For this, it 
is necessary to specify the source (part) for regeneration.
<P>
There are two ways to specify real generic for regeneration:
<UL><LI> Specify real generic class name
<P>
Regenerates specified real generic
<P>
<LI> Specify character string of real generic class name up to &quot;<b>&lt;</b>&quot;
<P>
Regenerates all real generic classes with the same class name as the 
specified character string located within the school. For example, when 
specifying character string &quot;Set&quot; for a real generic called Set<b>&lt;</b>String<b>&gt;</b>, 
other classes generated from Set<b>&lt;</b>*<b>&gt;</b> (such as Set<b>&lt;</b>School<b>&gt;</b>) 
included in the school will be held objective for regeneration.
