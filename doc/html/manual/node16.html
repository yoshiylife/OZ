<P>
The debugger released with this series performs the following four functions:
<OL><LI> Activates a launch with a debug flag is set.
<LI> Inspects both processes and global objects.
<LI> Provides a supplement of debug messages.
<LI> Provides a supplement of exceptional (anomalous) messages.
</OL>
Function 1) activates the process set by the debug flag.
<P>
Function 2) inspects the processes and global objects set by the debug
flag, and operates the debug flag processes.
<P>
Function 3) records the displayed debug message.
<P>
Function 4) supplements exceptional messages, and activates the inspector
of these processes.
<P>
At present there are two types of inspectors: one that operates by
itself, and another that is called from a different tool.  In both types,
the user interfaces involved are entirely different.  However, in future,
we plans to combine these two interfaces.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00045200000000000000>3.5.2 Activation and Termination</A></H3>
<P>
From the Launcher, which appears after the Executor is activated, an
object is generated and activated by the class name
'DebuggerFrontendLaunchable'.  For details of how to launch objects from
the Launcher, please refer to the README file of the Launcher.  After the
debugger front end is activated, a window (GUI) appears to execute the
previously mentioned function.  To terminate, select Quit from the Debugger
menu of this window.  However, functions which are already being activated
must be terminated one by one.
<P>
The Launch to which the debug flag is set <BR>
<P>
The debug flag indicates whether or not the debug statement is to be
executed.  Thus, it can set to each part of objects all the methods of
public, protected, private and record.  The debug flag is also present in a
process, and can be set when the process is forked. The Launcher for
debugging performs this forking of processes to set the debug flag.
(Caution: the processes mentioned here are not the UNIX processes, but are
OZ++ processes.)  Usually, preparation for the supplement of debug messages
mentioned later is performed before these operations.
<P>
<UL><LI> Activation and Termination of the Launcher for Debugging
<P>
The launcher for debugging is activated by selecting the button Launcher
in the Debugger menu.  However, this Launcher does not have the functions
of project management or instance management.  It can only fork processes
where the debug flag is set. However, in this case the class Launchable
must be inherited.  Press the Close button to terminate this Launcher.
<LI> How to Launch a Program
<OL><LI> Input either the class name or the class ID of public to be executed in
&quot;Class Name&quot;.  However, the Launchable must be inherited in this case.
This constraint is similar to the one required while activating the
Launcher of the Executor.  Activation (i.e. launching) of programs is
performed as specified in the Launchable class.
<LI> Set the Debug Flag
<P>
Perform the setups for executing debug statements written under the
specifications of OZ++.  One or more of the following items can be
selected:
<PRE>	Public
	Protected
	Private
	Record
</PRE>
These items corresponds to the access control of methods.  Debug statements
having the selected access control permission are to be executed.
<P>
<LI> Press the Initialize Button
<P>
Press this button to generate objects and call the method Initialize().
When these processes are completed, the button just pressed changes to
Launch.  Press the Clear button to abandon the generated processes and
objects and to enable operation on a fresh class.
<LI> Set the Debug Flag
<P>
<LI> Press the Launch Button
<P>
Press the Launch button to call the method Launch() of the previously
generated object.  Press the Clear button to abandon the generated
processes and global objects and to enable operation on a fresh class.
<LI> Press the Kill Button, If Necessary
<P>
Press the Kill button to cause the command kill, belonging to the OZ++
specification to terminate the process being executed by the method
Launch().  However, the Kill button does not behave as the SIGKILL of UNIX.
 This means that unless the program is written under the specifications of
OZ++, infinite loops can not be stopped.
</OL></UL>
<P>
Inspector of Processes and Global Objects <BR>
<P>
Select the Process button in the Debugger Menu to display a list of all
the processes.  Similarly, select the Object button in the Debugger menu to
display a list of all the objects.  Choose (i.e. double-clicked) the item
to be inspected from these  lists to display the inspector window.  If a
process is being inspected, it is temporarily suspended.  Similarly, if a
global object is under inspection, it is also temporarily suspended.  This
means that all threads on the global object also end up in a state of
suspension, so caution is required.  In either case, if the Inspector
window is closed, it reopens automatically.
<P>
Supplement for Debug Messages <BR>
<P>
Select the Message button in the Debugger menu to supplement the debug
messages and to display a window that displays these messages.  Debug
messages generated by the debug statements are displayed at the specified
address of the window.  If the address is set to default, the debug
messages appear in the &quot;Default&quot; window.  If the address is either a
process or a global object, the messages are displayed in the respective
process or the global object.  For each Executor, only one of these
functions can be activated at a time.
<P>
Supplement for Exceptional Messages <BR>
<P>
<DL ><DT>Not caught
<DD>Exceptional messages not supplemented by the program
<DT>caught	
<DD>Exceptional messages supplemented by the program
<DT>re-raise
<DD>Exceptional messages to transfer other exceptional messages
<DT>DoubleFault
<DD>Exceptional messages generated while processing other exceptional messages
<P>
 </DL>
If parameters of the exceptional message are objects, then inspection of
objects also begins.  If process inspection is terminated, the processing
of exceptional messages continues.  This function can be activated once at
a time for each Executor.
