This is an improved version of a simple browser.  It has the following new
functions:

editing, the 'Save' button must be pressed to affect the result in the
school.  Press the 'Done' button to return to the normal browser state.
<LI> The Package button is used to create a package to be released to 
the catalog. Click the Package button. A dialog box with package contents 
will appear after several seconds. At the top of the dialog box is the 
class to be registered to the school of the package. At the present, 
there is only one class (future library package will allow multiple 
classes). The bottom of the dialog box displays the list of possible 
classes for creation while activating the class indicated at the top. 
The Now button at the bottom creates a package that specifies a 
configuration of the class currently under use (with in the cache of the 
 object manager). The Default button creates a package that does not 
specify configuration but uses the default item specified in the class. 
Click the Now or Default button to open the catalog browser and to 
select the directory for registering the created package. When clicking 
Select at this time without making a selection, the currently displayed 
directory will be used.
