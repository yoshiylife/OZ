<P>
In the OZ++ system, all the global objects created on each executor 
are managed by the global object called the object manager.
<P>
If the object manager is implemented with OZ++ language,
it should be able to describe operation on global object of any class
by the language, because operation for all global object on the executor
could be described.
This means that a type which fits any class type and common methods
which are used to manage global object by the object manager 
should be introduced.
However, these will put secure strain on the programmer to be insisted 
to describe such methods on every classes for global objects.
<P>
To reduce this burden, the <tt> object</tt> class 
which has all the necessary processes 
for the object manager as methods and which is automatically mixed-in 
as a class to all classes when they are compiled, are introduced.  
With the <tt> object</tt> class, the object manager can process all global objects 
as instances of object class.  
Furthermore, if special processing is required in each class concerning 
the method defined by <tt> object</tt> class, the programmer can change programs of 
the method by overriding.
<P>
The mix-in of the <tt> object</tt> class is implemented with using 
the same mechanism as inheritance.  
Thus, it is impossible for the object manager to treat the instance of 
the global object of the static class because it is enabled to mix-in 
to the static class without inheritance.  
Therefore, the instance of the global object can not be generated 
from the static class.

<P>
The class <tt> object</tt> provides the following methods:
<P>
<UL><LI> <tt> void Go()</tt>
<P>
The object manager calls <tt> Go()</tt> method once just before it is enabled 
to call other methods after loading the object on the memory.  
The programmer can describe the process when the object is started up 
with redefinition of <tt> Go()</tt> in each class.
<P>
It is necessary to pay attention because (even indirectly) invoking the method 
by itself from <tt> Go()</tt> leads to deadlock.
<P>
<LI> <tt> void Shutdown()</tt>
<P>
The object manager calls <tt> Shutdown()</tt> once when it stops the object just 
before stopping the executor.  
The programmer can describe the process when the object is shut down 
with redefinition of <tt> Shutdown()</tt> in each class.  
Other methods will not be called after starting <tt> Shutdown()</tt> 
until the next starting section.
<P>
It is necessary to be careful because (even indirectly) invoking the method 
by itself from <tt> Shutdown()</tt> leads to deadlock.
<P>
<LI> <tt> void Removing()</tt>
<P>
The object manager calls method <tt> Removing()</tt>  once before 
the object is deleted. 
The programmer can describe the process when it is deleted by redefining 
<tt> Removing()</tt> in each class.  
Other methods are not called after starting Removing.
<P>
However, <tt> Shutdown()</tt> will not be called in this situation 
of calling <tt> Removing()</tt>.
<P>
It is necessary to be careful because (even indirectly) invoking 
the method by itself from <tt> Removing()</tt> leads to deadlock. 
However, it is possible to call <tt> Shutdown()</tt> from <tt> Removing()</tt>.
<P>
<LI> <tt> global ObjectManager Where()</tt>
<P>
The object ID of the object manager of an executor where the object exists 
is returned.
<P>
<LI> <tt> void Flush()</tt>
<P>
The image of the object at the time is written to the secondary memory.
<P>
<LI> <tt> void NewObject (global VersionID vid)</tt>
<P>
This is an abstract method generating the global object.
