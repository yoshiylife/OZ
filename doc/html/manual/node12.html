<H3><A NAME=SECTION00041100000000000000>3.1.1 Overview</A></H3>
<P>
This manual is for beginners.  It explains how to code, compile, and run 
simple OZ++ programs, so that programming in the OZ++ system can be 
easily understood.  It stresses comprehensiveness more than preciseness.
<P>
Few of the tool functions are explained.  After reading this document, 
refer to the documents for each tool for more details.
<P>

<P>
Until the executor is activated <BR>
<P>
OZ++ is a middle software that runs on an existent OS to provide a 
distributed programming environment.  Each user has to run a program 
called an executor on an existent OS.
<P>
OZ++ programs can also be compiled in this environment.  The following 
steps are required for environment setups when an executor is 
activated to perform programming:
<P>
<OL><LI> Setups of personal environment<BR> 
The following environment variables are set:
<blockquote> % setenv OZROOT <b>&lt;</b> directory where OZ++ is installed <b>&gt;</b><BR> 
        % setenv PATH $OZROOT/bin:$PATH
</blockquote>
<P>
In the following steps, it is presumed that the environment variables of
each process are already set.
<P>
<LI> Activation of each daemon
<blockquote> % ncl
</blockquote>
ncl is a command for activating the program called nucleus.  This program
 is one of the daemons of the OZ++ system.  It performs the address 
solution, and activates necessary daemons for code distribution, when 
a message is called across workstations.  Refer to the &quot;Nucleus&quot; documents.
<P>
<LI> Activation of nucleus front end (nfe)<BR> 
nfe is a tool for synthesizing and managing executors.  It also 
synthesizes necessary object images to run the executor. Refer to 
the documents of &quot;Nucleus Front End Editor.&quot; nfe can be executed 
from a UNIX shell as follows:
<blockquote> % nfe
</blockquote>
The following prompt appears after nfe is executed:
<blockquote> nfe<b>&gt;</b></blockquote>
<P>
<LI> Making a Site master<BR> 
An executor called Site master is required at each site to run the OZ++.
(Refer to &quot;Configuration of Management Objects.&quot;)  Make a Site master 
by referring to &quot;How to make an image.&quot;  This is done as follows:
<blockquote> nfe<b>&gt;</b> newimage -k site-master -d your.domain.jp -u yourname -n site-master
</blockquote>
<P>
<LI> Activation of a Site master
<blockquote> nfe<b>&gt;</b> cex $site-master
</blockquote>
cex is an nfe command that activates an executor.  Specify the name of th
e Site-master.  Instead of the name, the executor ID can also be specified.  T
he OZ++ Launcher will be activated in 10 minutes.
<P>
The following command can be executed to see the list of executors made.
<blockquote> nfe<b>&gt;</b> exidlist
</blockquote>
<P>
<LI> Synthesis of executor image <BR> 
New image files are required to run the executor providing a programming
environment.  Also, the following command is executed from nfe:
<blockquote> nfe<b>&gt;</b> newimage -n demo
</blockquote>
the next appears.
<PRE>        What kind of image do you want?
            1. Site master
            2. Station master
            3. Slave with a class object
            4. Slave with no class object
            9. Fully customized
            0. Help

        ?
</PRE>
The command newimage has options for performing appropriate setups from 
the executor running state.
<P>
Select 2. Station master.
<PRE>        ? 2             &lt;- type 2
</PRE>
If 2 is selected, the following message appears. Here, input the same 
domain name as that used for Site master.  Also input your name as the 
user name.
<PRE>        Enter domain name ? oz.ipa.go.jp
        Who are you [oz++] ?
</PRE>
After the inputs are complete, an image file is created.
<PRE>        Creating preload direction files ...
</PRE>
It is also possible to run the Site master and Station master on 
different work stations.  At least one Site master and one Station 
master (for programmers) are required at a site.  For more details, 
refer to &quot;Site&quot;.
<P>
<LI> Running the executor <BR> 
After the newimage is terminated, run its executor.  The following 
command can be executed from nfe:
<blockquote> nfe<b>&gt;</b> cex $demo
</blockquote></OL>
<P>
A simple example <BR>
<P>
In C language manuals for beginners, the program outputting the string 
&quot;Hello world&quot; is very popular. Here is a similar example for the OZ++ 
language.
<P>
<OL><LI> Coding <BR> 
Like C language, source programs of OZ++ are written in files. The 
following file is created under the name &quot;hello.oz&quot;.
<P>
<PRE>// hello.oz
class Hello : Launchable {
  void Launch(){
    // declare
    Console win;
    String hello;

    // construct
    win =&gt; New();
    hello =&gt; NewFromArrayOfChar( &quot;Hello world.\n&quot; );

    // act
    win -&gt; Open();
    win -&gt; Write( hello );
    win -&gt; Read(); // press any key
    win -&gt; Close();
  }
}
</PRE>
This program is explained below:
<OL><LI> OZ++ is an object-oriented language. Therefore, all programs 
are composed of classes. The class used in this program is called 
&quot;Hello.&quot; Superclasses are prepared by a system called &quot;Launchable.&quot; 
These classes are used when programs are executed from the launcher.
<P>
<LI> Launch() is a method and is run by the launcher. In this 
program, the class &quot;Hello&quot; contains only one method.
<P>
<LI> &quot;win&quot; and &quot;hello&quot; are local variables of the method Launch. 
These are console and String variables respectively. Console is a 
class that provides a terminal window using kterm. String is a class 
that provides character strings. Similar to C++ language, lines 
starting with '//' are remarks. Remarks having the style '/*..*/' 
can also be used.
<P>
<LI> Workbench<BR> 
Compilation of OZ++ is done in the OZ++ environment. For compilation, 
a tool called the workbench is activated. The workbench contains a 
collection of tools necessary for programming such as compiler, 
browser, etc. Refer to &quot;Using the Workbench.&quot; The Workbench is 
activated using a tool called the Launcher. Refer to &quot;Using the Launcher.&quot;
<P>
<OL><LI> Executing the Workbench<BR> 
Select Object from the Create menu provided in the Launcher. 
Enter '0001000002000413' in the field marked &quot;Class.&quot; Enter 'wb' in the 
field marked &quot;Name&quot;, then press the Accept button. &quot;wb&quot; (entered name 
in the field Name) will be displayed in the list box located on the 
right side of the screen. Double click &quot;wb.&quot;
<P>
<LI> Initializing the Workbench<BR> 
Enter the Class Object name of $demo executor after the Preference 
window of workbench appears. Refer to &quot;Explanation of newimage&quot; for 
details as to what type of names are used for Class Objects. In most 
cases, Class object names are composed in such manner as 
 ':classes:xxxxxx', with the 'xxxxxx' being the executor number 
(if the executor ID is 0001001003000000, then the executor number 
is 001003). The top window of the workbench will appear after pressing 
Done.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
<LI> Compile and configuration
<OL><LI> Creating a school<BR> 
The top window of the workbench displays the school listing. At first, 
this window will be blank. A school for the use of booting will be 
copied since creating one from scratch can be difficult. Select Add 
from the Operation menu. Enter an appropriate name ('test' is used 
here) as the school name when prompted.  The File Selector will then 
open files under $OZROOT/etc., and ask to select a school file. 
Double click &quot;boot-school&quot; located on the right of the list box. 
&quot;test&quot; will appear in the top window.
<P>
<LI> Loading the compiler front end<BR> 
The pop-up menu will appear when double clicking &quot;test&quot; in the top 
window. Compiler front end (CFE) control screen will appear when 
&quot;compiler&quot; is selected.
<P>
<LI> Selecting a file<BR> 
Select Add on the Compiler menu of CFE to the open file selector. Use 
this file selector to select the source file and load to CFE. If the 
source file (hello.oz) is located directly under the current directory, 
then double click the source file. Otherwise move to the directory 
with the source file. This is possible by selecting the directory 
list on the left in order. To move to the directory above, double 
click &quot;..&quot;. &quot;hello.oz&quot; will appear in the CFE once selected.
<P>
<LI> Compile<BR> 
Pop-up menu will appear when double clicking &quot;hello.oz&quot; of CFE. 
Select &quot;Compile&quot; and the dialog box for selecting compile options 
will appear. Select &quot;New&quot; then &quot;from public&quot; from the submenu when 
compiling files for the first time with a particular school. Then 
select &quot;All&quot; when the dialog box reappears. &quot;New&quot; is a function that 
registers the class of entry to the school and create new versions. 
Therefore, this function is not necessary when recompiling files. 
Error dialog box will appear in case of an error when compiling. 
Compile is successful when the mouse cursor returns to the original 
form from the clock form (and if the dialog box does not appear).
<P>
<LI> Configuration<BR> 
Configuration is necessary after completing compile. Double click 
&quot;hello.oz&quot; of CFE. Select &quot;Configuration.&quot; Click the Go button when 
the dialog box appears. It is recommended that you read carefully 
&quot;Explanation of workbench&quot; before proceeding since compiling is very 
complicated.
<P>
<LI> Registering to catalog<BR> 
Return to the top window of the workbench and double click the school.
Select &quot;School Browser&quot; when the pop-up menu appears. The school 
browser will appear. Select the Operation-Search menu to open the 
dialog box. Enter &quot;Hello&quot; then press the Go button. ID of each Hello 
class parts compiled will appear. Press the Package button. Listing 
of classes to be packaged will appear. Press the Default button at 
the bottom to open the dialog box. Enter &quot;Hello&quot; for the package 
name then press Done. The catalog browser will appear. Press Select 
to complete register.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
<LI> Program execution<BR> 
Programs are executed from the Launcher. First, open the Create-Package 
menu.  Select &quot;Hello&quot; in the entries list on the right with the mouse, 
then press the Select button on the bottom right hand corner. Use the 
radio button (object/package switch) of the Launcher to switch to the 
package side. Double click &quot;Hello&quot; to open the dialog box. Enter 
'Hello1' then press the Accept button. Use the radio button to switch 
back to the object side. Double click &quot;Hello1&quot; in the list box located 
on the right side. kterm will appear and &quot;Hello world.&quot; will appear 
on the screen. Press the Enter key to close window.
