ozag - OZ application gateway
<DT>SYNOPSIS
<DD> <P>
ozag
<DT>DESCRIPTION
<DD> <P>
The application gateway is executed in a gateway machine, and
performs the following services to one or more sites:
<P>
<blockquote> <UL><LI> relay of executors outside the OZ++ site.
<LI> relay of method invocations and return values, as well as
insertion of external flags against external packets, both
to and from outside the OZ++ site.
<LI> relay of class file transfer packets both to and from outside
the OZ++ site.
</UL></blockquote>
<P>

<P>
<DT>FILE
<DD> <P>
<UL><LI> $OZROOT/etc/SITE_table
This site table is read when the application gateway is started.
<P>
If this file does not exist when the application gateway is started,
the application gateway loads data of site table from WWW server
automatically.
<P>
At the first line of the file, the last updated date
of the site information is recorded.
The site table contains the following items:
<UL><LI> site ID
<LI> host name or the IP address of the application gateway in
the site corresponding to the site ID
</UL>
<P>
<LI> $OZROOT/etc/apgw_LSiteInfo<BR> 
This local site information is read when the application gateway
is started.  Local site information describes the site information
recognized by the application gateway.  If the application gateway
manages more than one sites, their information is also registered
in the local site information.  The local site information contains
the following items:
<UL><LI> site ID
<LI> host name or the IP address of the relay nucleus corresponding
to the site ID
<LI> port number of the relay nucleus corresponding to the site ID
<LI> type of the site(P[progressive],C[conservative],I[invalidated])
</UL></UL> 
 </DL><H3><A NAME=SECTION00036200000000000000>2.6.2 Starting the Application Gateway</A></H3>
<P>
The application gateway is started as an OS process from a terminal.
<P>
The application gateway creates log files at startup, and its file name
  appeared on the terminal.
<P>

<P>

<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00036300000000000000>2.6.3 Terminating the Application Gateway</A></H3>
<P>
The 'exit' command terminates the application gateway.
<P>
Signal(SIGTERM) terminates the application gateway also.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00036400000000000000>2.6.4 Setup of Local Site Information</A></H3>
<P>
There are two paths for the relay of inter-site communication by the
application gateway:
<blockquote> <UL><LI> Relay between a local site and another site (see figure <A HREF="node10.html#fig1">2.6--1</A>)<BR> 
Relay is performed between a site managed by the application
gateway and the other sites.
<LI> Relay inside a local site (see figure <A HREF="node10.html#fig2">2.6--2</A>)<BR> 
The application gateway manages several sites, and performs relay
within the range of the management.

<P>
The site ID, registered as local site information, must already be
registered in the site table.
<P>
In the setup of local site information, only the information for one
site is described per line of the file.  The usage is described below:
<PRE>    &lt;site ID&gt;:&lt;rncl IP-Address&gt;:&lt;rncl port&gt;:&lt;type of site&gt;
</PRE>
There are two types of sites: progressive policy sites and conservative
policy sites.
<P>
Objects in a progressive policy site can be accessed
from outside of the site, and can access to objects of other sites.
Objects in a conservative policy site can access to objects of other sites,
but can not be accessed from outside of the site.
<P>
  The local site information can be modified using 'add','remove','change'
commands. But it's possible to setup the contents of the file directly.
<P>
Setup of Local Site Information between a Local Site and Another Site <BR>
<P>
In this case, the local site information is registered as follows:
<PRE>  Setup of Site-1:
     Site-1:&lt;IP-Address of R-Ncl1&gt;:&lt;port of R-Ncl1&gt;:&lt;type of site&gt;
</PRE>
<PRE>  Setup of Site-2:
     Site-2:&lt;IP-Address of R-Ncl2&gt;:&lt;port of R-Ncl2&gt;:&lt;type of site&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
For example, this information is described as follows:
<P>
Local site information of Site-1
<PRE>     % cat $OZROOT/etc/apgw_LSiteInfo
     0005:bunax3:3777:C
</PRE>
<P>
Local site information of Site-2
<PRE>     % cat $OZROOT/etc/apgw_LSiteInfo
     0001:bun13:3777:P
</PRE>
<P>
Setup of Local Site Information inside a Local Site <BR>
<P>
In this case, the local site information is registered as follows:
<PRE>     Site-2:&lt;IP-Address of R-Ncl2&gt;:&lt;port of R-Ncl2&gt;:&lt;type of site&gt;
     Site-3:&lt;IP-Address of R-Ncl3&gt;:&lt;port of R-Ncl3&gt;:&lt;type of site&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
For example, this information is described as follows:
<PRE>     % cat $OZROOT/etc/apgw_LSiteInfo
     0005:bunax3:3777:P
     0001:192.31.202.11:3777:P
</PRE>
<P>
Setup of a Relay Nucleus <BR>
<P>
The relay nucleus communicates with the application gateway, and
relays the transmission of demands to and reception of demands from
other sites.
<P>
The setup of a relay nucleus defines the application gateway
corresponding to the relay nucleus in the nucleus table.
<P>
<PRE>    RELAYNCL:&lt;IP-Address of Relay Nucleus&gt;:&lt;OZAG IP-Address&gt;
</PRE>
For those nuclei registered as relay nuclei, it is necessary to
maintain mutual consistency between these nuclei and the relay nuclei
registered in the local site information of the application gateway.
<P>
For example, when the relay nucleus is set to bun13, and the
application gateway is set to bunax3:
<PRE>     % cat $OZROOT/etc/apgw_LSiteInfo
     0005:bun13:3777:P
     % cat $OZROOT/etc/ncl-data/NCL_table
     RELAYNCL:bun13:bunax3
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00036500000000000000>2.6.5 Site Table</A></H3>
<P>
The site table ($OZROOT/etc/SITE_table) is the text file read when
the application gateway is started.  It contains the following items:
<PRE>    &lt;site ID&gt;:&lt;host name or the IP-Address of the application gateway&gt;:

   Example:
     % cat $OZROOT/etc/SITE_table
     #Sunday, 09-Feb-97 06:24:39 GMT
     0004:192.33.202.15:
     0005:bunax3:
     0006:bun17
     0007:192.31.202.11:
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00036600000000000000>2.6.6 Commands of the Application Gateway</A></H3>
<P>
  The application gateway accepts following commands. They can be grouped
to three category, site information related, local site information 
related and miscellaneous.
<P>
<PRE>      list
      update
      local

<H3><A NAME=SECTION00036800000000000000>2.6.8 Trouble Shooting of the Application Gateway</A></H3>
<P>
There may be cases in which the application gateway cannot be started
due to some troubles.  The following causes may be considered:
<blockquote> <DL ><DT>(1)
<DD> The necessary files to start the application gateway cannot be opened.<BR> 
The following files are necessary to start the application gateway:
<UL><LI> $OZROOT/etc/SITE_table
<LI> $OZROOT/etc/apgw_LSiteInfo
</UL>
In this case, the following factors can be considered as causes:
<UL><LI> Environment variable OZROOT is not set properly.
<LI> Permissions of files under the directory $OZROOT is not given.
<LI> There are errors in the description of the site table
($OZROOT/etc/SITE_table).
</UL>
<DT>(2)
<DD> The port used by the nucleus cannot be bound.<BR> 
The following message is displayed:
<PRE>     init_apgw_port: bind: Address already in use
     init_apgw_port: Other APGW start up already ?
</PRE>
The following causes may be considered:
<UL><LI> The station, where the start up is performed, already has another
application gateway running.
<LI> The port is bound by another application other than the
application gateway.
</UL>
<DT>(3)
<DD> Error in the Setup of Local Site Information<BR> 
The following message is displayed:
<PRE>     init_localsite_info: Can't found LocalSiteID(????) on site-table
</PRE>
This occurs because the site ID in the local site information is not
registered in the site table.
